"""POST /v1/windows, tasks A2 and A3 of issue #4.

The route does four things and nothing else:

1. validates the body against the frozen schema ``windows_request.json``, because
   that file is the contract for everyone under Seam 2;
2. asks the engine seam for the body, which is ``backend.engine.compute_windows``
   once ENGINE lands and the offline stub until then;
3. composes the weather fields that the engine seam does not own;
4. stamps ``constants_block`` and ``provenance_block`` from configuration.

It never converts a physics answer into an HTTP error. Unreachable, no windows and
constraint fired are 200 with a body, per spec IV.7 rules 1 and 3.
