"""The service against the real ``backend.engine`` and ``backend.weather``.

Every other file of this suite runs the offline path or a stand-in module (see
``conftest.layers``). The tests here run the two real modules through the routes, so a
mismatch at a seam shows up as a failing test and not as a silently neutral number.
Each of them records a defect that was found when ENGINE and WEATHER landed:

* the service default ``criteria_version`` was refused by the weather layer, the window
  route swallowed the refusal and every window was served with the weather factor 1.0;
* an unknown site reached the engine and came back as an unhandled ``ValueError``;
* ``lead_max`` changed the reliability bins of the skill endpoint on the live path and
  only the series on the recorded path.

The weather layer runs with ``LAUNCHWIN_WEATHER_OFFLINE=1`` and an empty private cache,
so it answers from the committed snapshot and climatology and never from the network.
Expected weather values are taken from the weather layer in the same process, not typed
here, so the tests do not depend on the day they run.

    WHAT CHANGED HERE. The assertion used to be that EVERY row carries
    ``criteria_version_missing``, which was true only while every row was a
    southbound flight. The engine now computes the launch azimuth per site
    crossing, so the ascending crossing of the SSO plane is correctly reported as a
    northbound launch and is correctly refused by the Canso southbound corridor with
    ``hazard_area``. The sibling test below already fixes the precedence in that
    situation: an engine constraint is never overwritten by the API's own.

    WHAT IS ASSERTED NOW, AND IT IS NOT WEAKER. Every row must still name a
    constraint, so an unknown criteria version can never pass through silently.
    Every row the engine reports as range-clear must name
    ``criteria_version_missing`` specifically, which is the original assertion
    applied to exactly the rows where the API's constraint is the operative one.
    And the rows the engine refused must name the engine's own constraint, so the
    precedence is asserted rather than assumed.
