"""The FastAPI application and the error model of spec IV.7, task A2 of issue #4.

Every /v1 router is mounted under one versioned prefix, and the OpenAPI document is
served from inside that prefix at ``/v1/openapi.json`` as spec IV requires.

The handlers are the whole point of this module. Spec IV.7 reserves 4xx for four
conditions only, so each handler here is a thin mapping from one exception to one
status code, one JSON body and, where the specification demands it, one header:

* a request the engine cannot interpret is 422, never 500, and the body names the
  frozen schema the request violated;
* an orbit, site or run id the service does not know is 404 with a JSON detail,
  because it is a genuine resource miss and not a domain outcome;
* a spent request budget is 429 with Retry-After;
* a dead upstream is 503 with Retry-After and a body that states which offline
  fixture path is answering, so that no client can mistake a precomputed answer for
  a live one (spec V.5).

Physics outcomes are not here, and must never be added here: unreachable, an empty
window list and a fired constraint are answers and belong in the 200 body.
