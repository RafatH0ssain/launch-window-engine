"""E10. GATE G1: reproduce published launch windows. Spec III.2.

THE CREDIBILITY TEST. This test stays in the suite permanently. It is what unblocks
frontend work on live data.

PROTOCOL. For each published launch in ``data/published_windows.json`` the engine
is given ONLY:

  * the site coordinates,
  * the PUBLISHED target inclination,
  * the PUBLISHED local time of the ascending or descending node,
  * the date of the published launch,

and must produce a window centre within the tolerance of the PUBLISHED launch
instant. The published RAAN is never given, and never back-solved from the
launch time, because back-solving would make the test circular and worthless.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT THE ENGINE'S INPUT. The node time determines the PLANE, so the
required RAAN is date-indexed and the engine derives it from the Sun's right
ascension through (II.19). The residual that remains is the site's position in
the plane, which is what the site-to-node offset delta of (II.10) carries. That
is why the Plesetsk anchor at 62.9 N, whose delta is about -17.5 deg, is the
sharpest: a low-latitude site has a delta near zero and would hide a missing term.

BRANCH, AND WHY BOTH SITE CROSSINGS COUNT. A descending node at 10:00 and an
ascending node at 22:00 are the SAME plane, so the published branch fixes the
plane and not which launch instant is used. Into any one plane the site crosses
TWICE per period, on (II.9)'s ascending branch and on its descending branch, and
both are legitimate launch opportunities. The gate therefore asks the right
question: is the published launch instant one of the engine's opportunities into
the published plane? Which branch matched is reported, so the reader can see it.

Earlier versions of this test paired the published branch with a single site
crossing. That double-counted the branch and moved EarthCARE by 12 hours, which
is why the formulation here is stated explicitly rather than assumed.

TOLERANCE. The data file states it and it is not relaxed anywhere in this file.
Spec III.2 sets +/-2 min; the issue brief sets 5 min. Both are asserted, so a
regression that slips inside 5 minutes but outside 2 is still caught.
