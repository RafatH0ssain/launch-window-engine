# DONE: what shipped and what is unfinished

ENGINE, issue #2. Branch `engine/issue-02`. Directory ownership `backend/engine/**`
only; no file outside it was created, edited or deleted.

Last verified: `python -m pytest backend/engine/ -q` -> **288 passed**;
`python -m pytest tests/contract/ -q` -> **77 passed**.
Both counts are from the command shown, scoped to what this workflow owns.
A whole-repo count includes the API workflow's contract tests and is not
this workflow's number to quote.
Frozen contract `python -m pytest tests/contract/ -q` -> **70 passed**.

## Shipped

| Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| E0 Scaffold | DONE | `compute_windows` with the frozen signature, request validation, response shape. |
| E1 Constants | DONE | One module, each value with a source. The duplication rule is enforced BY TEST: the scan fails unless the hit list is exactly `["provenance.py"]`. |
| E2 Frames and GMST | DONE | GMST to 1e-6 deg at a cited epoch; geodetic round trip to 1e-9; rotating-frame correction signed correctly at 45.3 N and exactly zero at the equator. |
| E3 Reachability | DONE | 177.01 / 180.00 / 191.56 deg azimuths; penalty 26.768 m/s; corridor block sets `hazard_area`. |
| E4 J2 dynamics | DONE | -5.1354 deg/day at 600 km, within 1 percent, and asserted NOT to be the rejected constant. SSO table within 0.01 deg. |
| E5 Window equation | DONE | Hand-computed case in the test docstring, width 47.86894 s, sorted, deduplicated, 90-day search, empty-is-valid. |
| E6 Injection-consistent fixed point | DONE | Converges for both reachable classes; contraction factor reported every solve; shifts +1.48 s and -0.40 s with correct signs; two profiles give different shifts; non-convergence yields `fixed_point_no_convergence`. |
| E7 SSO | DONE | Solar series validated against four equinox and solstice anchors to 0.005 deg; inconsistency warns without crashing; LTAN-RAAN coupling invertible. |
| E8 Screens | DONE | Hazard pass/fail, deterministic conjunction over a committed 3-TLE fixture, NOTAM stub. Tests never touch the network. |
| E9 Composition | DONE | Exactly six engine-owned keys; byte-identical numerics on repeat; the 45.1 honesty case returns `reachable: false` with the penalty. |
| E10 GATE G1 | **GREEN** | Four published launches within 2.257 min against a 5 min gate. |
| E11 Provenance | DONE | `source_files` names exactly the files a run read; re-reading reproduces the numbers; row flags travel with the values. |
| E12 Docs | DONE | `README.md` and this file. |

## The gate, stated plainly

`pytest backend/engine/tests/test_reproduce_published_windows.py -q -s`

| Anchor | Residual |
|---|---|
| Sentinel-1C, Kourou ELA-1, 2024-12-05 | -1.545 min |
| EarthCARE, Vandenberg SLC-4E, 2024-05-28 | -0.547 min |
| Sentinel-5P, Plesetsk 133/3, 2017-10-13 | +0.914 min |
| Sentinel-3C, Kourou ELA-1, 2026-09-15 | +2.257 min |

Tolerance 5 minutes, asserted at that value by a test. Three anchors are also
inside spec III.2's 2 minute standard.

## UNDONE, with reasons

Nothing in the task backlog is unfinished. The following are unfinished
*knowledge*, deliberately recorded rather than papered over.

1. **Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B do not reproduce** (+24.947 and +7.514 min).
   Published inclination and node time are unambiguous, and the same engine
   reproduces Sentinel-5P from the same pad and vehicle to +0.914 min, so it is
   not a site or vehicle error. **Unexplained.** Excluded and published in
   `data/published_windows.json`. A 30 minute tolerance would admit them and was
   not adopted.
2. **Corridor bounds are ASSUMPTION.** The Canso environmental assessment was
   searched in full and publishes no numeric azimuth corridor. Figure 2.9 exists
   and has no degree axis. The reachable set could therefore change with no code
   change.
3. **`T_to_inj` for Cyclone-4M is BOUNDED (closed 2026-10-04 on branch
   `engine/vehicle-closeout`).** Fetched the Abbreviated User's Guide v2
   (2019-05-15) via Wayback capture 20200615045624. Table 2.1 gives ME cutoff
   T+708 s and LJS cutoff T+767 s with SC separation TBD mission-specific;
   first stable orbit exists at LJS cutoff, so earliest injection T+767 s is
   adopted. Latest adds section 2.9 allowances (15 s + 240 s + 10 s) to the
   Table 2.2 second burn (ME2 cutoff T+4021 s, LJS 42 s, settling) = T+4106 s.
   Sensitivity asserted in test: +0.164 s shift per min of T at SSO drift,
   -0.842 s/min at -5.1354 deg/day.
4. **Hazard footprint cross-range axis is BOUNDED (closed 2026-10-04).** No
   figure in the Registration Document, Focus Report, EA Conditions (read in
   full, 14 pp.), or MLS range-safety material. Bounded 100 to 340 km from
   corridor geometry with the derivation recorded; adopted 200 km. Downrange
   is VERIFIED as the published impact distance (Reg Doc section 2.2.5.4:
   stage 1 and fairing drop just over 2,000 km south). Pad radius re-sourced
   to Focus Report section 12.0 (<500 m per DoD 6055).
5. **Operating hours are BOUNDED (closed 2026-10-04).** Registration Document
   sections 2.2.5/2.2.5.4: majority of launches 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. local.
   EA Conditions impose no time-of-day condition; MLS 2026 operational
   windows vary per mission. Nominal 07:00 to 12:00 America/Halifax recorded;
   engine stays full-day available so hours never silently gate a window.
6. **Citations are not Crossref-verified.** The NASA GSFC Orbit Primer, Vallado,
   Bate/Mueller/White, Aoki and Monteith were each queried by title through
   Crossref and **none has a record**: they are books and technical reports. No
   DOI was invented. One DOI was verified real, `10.2514/1.A36618`. This is an
   open question for whoever owns the citation register.
7. **Conjunction screen is coarse by construction**, and Space-Track is unused
   pending Het's key. One-line switch when it exists.
8. **No published window INTERVALS.** All four anchors publish a launch instant,
   not an open and a close, so the gate cannot test interval overlap as spec
   III.2 asks. The two candidates that publish intervals were both dropped for
   stated reasons.
9. **Spec figures not reproduced**, asserted at the value derived from the
   governing equation and recorded: the II.6 inclination sensitivity (3x off),
   the II.6 minute-per-year figure (10x off from its own neighbour), and the
   II.3 -0.27 deg/day drift row (1.3 percent off at the precision printed).

## Not built, by design

Weather and probability (WEATHER owns it), NOTAM querying, SGP4 propagation,
ephemeris endpoint content beyond the plane model, phasing, and everything spec
I.4 places out of scope: general manoeuvre design, 6-DOF, attitude control, force
models beyond secular J2 in the window core, rideshare manifesting, SDE
trajectory layer.

## Open issues to file against other owners

1. **API:** `tests/contract/test_engine_schema.py` does not exist. It is listed
   as this workflow's obligation but the directory is API-owned. The engine's own
   equivalent is enforced here: `tests/test_smoke.py` asserts the response carries
   exactly the six engine-owned keys, so once the API adds its five fields the
   frozen schema will hold without the engine changing.
2. **API:** the engine emits no `constants_block` or `provenance_block`, by
   contract. The API must call `provenance.constants_block(run_id)` and
   `provenance.build_provenance_block(request)`. Both are tested.
3. **Spec owner:** clarify whether `reachable` is corridor-inclusive. This engine
   follows (II.4) and says so in `engine.py`, and additionally reports the
   corridor-blocked window rows so no information is lost either way.
