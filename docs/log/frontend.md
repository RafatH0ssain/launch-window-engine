# Frontend log

Session covering GitHub issue 5 tasks F0, F1 and F2 only. Every line below is an exact command and its observed output.

## Commands run

```text
$ cd frontend && npx vitest run
```

First run, before `src/` existed, to record the red state:

```text
 Test Files  4 failed (4)
      Tests  no tests
Error: Failed to resolve import "../src/config.js" from "tests/windowEngine.test.js". Does the file exist?
```

Final run:

```text
 Test Files  4 passed (4)
      Tests  24 passed (24)
   Duration  403ms (environment 71%, tests 14%, transform 10%, import 5%, worker 1%)

## Interpretations and open points

1. **Earliest reachable window.** Spec V.1 says the countdown ticks to the earliest row with reachable windows. Reachability is a response level field, so a row is taken to be reachable when the response is `reachable` and the row carries no hazard rejection. A row with `constraint_fired: hazard_area` or `screens.hazard: fail` is refused as a countdown target, which is the UI level guard the issue asks for against the northbound rows in the prototype mocks.
2. **Engine reason for an empty list.** The frozen response has no `reason` field on the response and none on an empty `windows` array. The reason rendered is therefore taken from `sso_consistency_warning` when the engine sends one, otherwise from the documented meaning of an empty array in `tests/contract/schemas/windows_response.json`, otherwise from `reachable: false`. Nothing is invented. If API wants a `reason` string on the response, this needs a contract change, not a frontend guess.
3. **Preset altitude is not pre-filled.** `h_t_km` is not required for the LEO, POLAR and SSO types, and the three sources disagree on its value: the prototype used 700 km, `windows_request_good_sso_full.json` uses 550 km and spec VI.2 shows 600 km. The screen therefore leaves it empty with the label `backend default`, and only CUSTOM requires a value. No altitude default was invented.
4. **Vehicle flag is read, not declared.** The T_to_inj VERIFIED or ASSUMPTION flag belongs to `backend/engine/data/vehicles/cyclone4m.json`, which ENGINE owns and which does not exist on this branch. The screen reads it from `provenance_block.row_flags` and, when the response declares none, names the owning file instead of showing a flag. This is the one F2 sub item that cannot show a flag on this branch.
5. **Outage with a previous live response.** On a failed re-fetch the app keeps the last successful response and marks it `api_stale` rather than overwriting it with fixtures, because spec V.1 requires the countdown to survive an outage using the last fetched target. The `offline_precomputed` banner and mode are set either way. The fixture data is used when no live response has arrived yet.
6. **One POST per committed change.** The form listens for `change`, so every committed edit posts exactly once, with a request sequence number so a late response cannot overwrite a newer one. The prototype debounce is dropped because it is neither needed nor permitted by the one POST per input change rule.
7. **Editing the inclination switches to CUSTOM.** Inherited from the prototype. Since `ltan_hours` is SSO only in the frozen schema, the plane selector switches to RAAN at the same time.
8. **Corridor override needs one bound to be sent.** The schema allows either bound to be null, so the screen sends whichever bound is filled and sends no corridor key when both are empty.
9. **No Leaflet import in F0 to F2.** No in scope screen renders a map, so the library is not loaded. F3 will import `frontend/node_modules/leaflet/dist/leaflet.js` and its stylesheet from the repository rather than a CDN, which is recorded in `README.md`.
10. **Clock widget and confidence tiers dropped.** The wall clock is traceable to no response object and the confidence tiers were invented in the browser, so both are dropped in the audit rather than carried forward.
11. **Tests use `tests/contract/examples/good/`.** `backend/fixtures/` does not exist on this branch and API owns it, so no fixture was created and the frozen examples serve as the mock payloads.

## Not done in this session

F3 to F9 are untouched: the trajectory map and the 3D scene, the weather panel and the skill curve, the viewing map, the analysis view and the exports, the fixture content, the requirements map, and `frontend/DONE.md`. `frontend/progress.md` was not written because this session was instructed to limit writes to `frontend/` deliverables and `docs/log/frontend.md`; this file carries the log the workflow doc asks for.

## Test to requirement map

## Interpretations and open points

1. **The ephemeris is fetched per row, not per orbit class.** Spec V.2 says each row highlights "its own track" and IV.2 gives the query `?start=ISO&end=ISO&step_s=number`. The screen therefore sends `start` as `t_liftoff_utc` and `end` as `t_injection_utc` of the clicked row, which is what makes the fetched track match the row. `step_s` is sent as 300 s, the documented server default, so the URL is explicit.
2. **The CUSTOM target has no ephemeris id.** IV.2 says the engine creates a custom id implicitly and puts it in the response `orbit_id`, but the frozen `windows_response` schema has `additionalProperties: false` and no `orbit_id`. No id is invented: the screen asks for no track and names the gap. This needs a contract change, not a frontend guess.
3. **Two weather indicators, one threshold table.** Spec V.3 thresholds `p_launch`, issue F4 thresholds `p_success_components.weather`. Both are rendered, each with the same `WEATHER_THRESHOLDS`, so neither reading of the contract is hidden and each number stays traceable to one response field.
4. **The hazard buffer width is missing on this branch.** `hazard_half_width_km` is `null` in `src/config.js` for `cyclone4m`, because the value belongs to `backend/engine/data/vehicles/cyclone4m.json`, which ENGINE owns and which does not exist here. The buffer is implemented and tested through an injected value; the shipped default states the gap and names the owner. Nothing was invented.
5. **The frozen ephemeris example leaves the corridor.** `ephemeris_response_good_leo45.json` has a second sample at 48.11 N, which is north of Canso and outside the 100 to 140 deg corridor, so the guard rejects it. That is the northbound bug of the prototype appearing in the frozen example, and it is asserted as such rather than worked around.
6. **Population centre coordinates are ASSUMPTION.** No gazetteer was reachable offline, so every row of `src/data/centres.json` carries its own `flag` and the file carries a note. The screen prints the coordinates it uses and the file names them as unverified.
7. **The solar expression is cited from memory and flagged.** The formula source string in `src/config.js` names the Astronomical Almanac and the NOAA Solar Calculator and states that neither citation was resolved online. The accuracy claim is not made; the expression is flagged `ASSUMPTION` and printed on the screen.
8. **A sunlit vehicle cannot be strictly above a dark observer's horizon.** The shadow half angle `asin(R_e/(R_e+h))` and the horizon half angle `acos(R_e/(R_e+h))` sum to 90 degrees, so the only sunlit cases at a visible centre are twilight cases at or just above the depressed horizon. The test asserts such a sample, and asserts the elevations on both sides of the horizon, instead of asserting an impossible configuration.
9. **The site read is triggered by the first selection.** Screen 1 must issue exactly one POST per input change, and the F1 test counts the calls on load, so `GET /v1/site` is read with the rest of the row resources rather than on load. The fetch order is documented in `README.md` as spec V.7 requires.
10. **No tile layer.** Leaflet is drawn with vector layers only, because the demo runs with the network off and a tile request would fail visibly. Adding a tile layer is one line when a network is available.
11. **The 3D globe is cut.** Spec V.2 makes it optional and says to cut it before any 2D feature. The two tests of F3 assert the 2D map only.
12. **`centres.json` has no fixture fallback.** It is a repository file, not an API resource, so a read failure is reported on the screen. Every API read does fall back to its fixture.

## Not done in this session

F6 to F9: the scientific analysis view with the reliability diagram, the constants and provenance table and the CSV and JSON exports, the fixture content that API owns, `frontend/REQUIREMENTS_MAP.md`, `frontend/SLIDE.md`, `frontend/DONE.md` and `frontend/progress.md`. `frontend/AUDIT.md` is left as the F0 to F2 record; the F3 to F5 dispositions are in this file and in `frontend/README.md`.

# Session covering the fixtures, F6, F7, F8 and F9

Same branch, built on the F0 to F5 modules. `src/api.js`, `src/store.js`, `src/config.js` and the four existing screens were extended, not rewritten, and no existing test was changed or weakened. The 43 tests that existed at the start of this session still pass unchanged; 8 cases were added, for 51.

## Files created

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/tools/make_fixtures.py` | Regenerates `backend/fixtures/windows.json` and `backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` from one geometry, then validates all five fixtures against the frozen schemas. Standard library only, no network, no install |
| `frontend/src/export.js` | The client-side exports of spec V.6: the rendered window table as CSV, the Brier skill series as CSV, the reliability bins as CSV, the response as JSON, and `downloadText`, which turns a finished string into a file through an anchor |
| `frontend/src/screens/analysis.js` | Screen 5: the Brier skill table and chart, the vehicle duration per row, the reliability diagram and the ROC points, the constants block with sources, the criteria version, the config hash, the provenance panel with every declared source file, the four download buttons and the fixture links |
| `frontend/tests/analysis.test.js` | The F6 cases, 6 of them |
| `frontend/tests/offline.test.js` | The F7 cases, 2 of them, with the network blocked and the real fixture files read from disk |

| `frontend/REQUIREMENTS_MAP.md` | One row per slide requirement, each naming its component and its exact test name, with the one gap marked NOT DONE |
| `frontend/DONE.md` | What shipped, what is known unfinished, with the commands and results |

## Files changed

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/fixtures/windows.json` | Regenerated. The only field that changed is `t_injection_utc` on each row, now exactly 600 s after `t_liftoff_utc`. Every other field, including `engine_version` `stub`, the constants and provenance blocks and `computation_ms`, is carried over byte for byte |
| `backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` | Regenerated for `sso981`: 192 samples at 60 s from the first liftoff, two orbital periods, constant 550 km, `ground_track_valid` true, the first sample exactly on the site. The `constants_block` is carried over |
| `frontend/src/svgChart.js` | Added `renderReliabilityDiagram`, inline SVG from `reliability_bins`, with the perfect reliability diagonal and the base rate marked. `renderSkillCurve` and `renderElevationCurve` untouched |
| `frontend/src/app.js` | The optional `analysisHost`, the analysis screen in the render fan out and in `stop()`, nothing else changed |
| `frontend/src/main.js` | Passes `analysisHost` |
| `frontend/index.html` | The `screen-analysis` host |
| `frontend/styles.css` | Styles for the download buttons, the source file list and the two new chart rules |
| `frontend/tests/helpers.js` | `loadFixtureFile` reads a real file from `backend/fixtures`; `mountIndexMarkup` and `boot` return and pass `analysisHost` |
| `frontend/README.md` | Stack and why, how to run, the fixture path table, the countdown specification, the stubbed versus live table, the Screen 5 element table, the offline floor and the fixture conflicts reported below. The stale sentences about the fixture files not existing were corrected |
| `docs/log/frontend.md` | This section |

## Test to requirement map

| Requirement | Test |
|---|---|
| F6 download produces a file whose rows equal the rendered table | `tests/analysis.test.js` first case: the anchor href and `download` attribute captured, the Blob read back, the header row equal to the rendered headers and every data row equal to the rendered row cell by cell and, independently, to the formatted values of the response row |
| F6 the provenance panel shows every source file the run declared | `tests/analysis.test.js` second case: one `li[data-source-file]` per `provenance_block.source_files` entry, plus every constant value, every `source of` entry, the criteria version, the vehicle profile, the engine version and the config hash |
| F6 Brier skill table and chart | `tests/analysis.test.js` third case |
| F6 reliability diagram and ROC points | `tests/analysis.test.js` fourth case |
| F6 vehicle duration surfaced as `liftoff_instant_error_min` | `tests/analysis.test.js` fifth case, added because the F8 map row for the slide bonus names that number and the issue asks for it to be surfaced |
| F6 fixture links and claim status | `tests/analysis.test.js` sixth case |
| F7 with the network fully blocked the app loads, all screens render, the countdown works, the banner is present | `tests/offline.test.js` first case: every URL under `API_BASE` refused with a failed fetch, all five repository fixtures read from disk, five screens asserted element by element, the clock pinned so the countdown reads `1d 23:42:17` and `1d 23:42:15` two seconds later |
| F7 the fallback renders the same element tree as the live path | `tests/offline.test.js` second case: the same five documents served from the API in one run and from the fixtures in the other, then the tag and id signature of all five screen hosts and the rendered row cells compared for equality |

## Interpretations and open points

1. **The ephemeris starts at the site, so the RAAN is solved rather than declared.** A circular orbit at inclination 98.1 deg crossing latitude 45.3 deg on the southbound branch has the argument of latitude fixed, and the ECEF longitude at the first liftoff then fixes the RAAN in closed form. The solve gives 300.467797 deg. The window rows keep the stub run's declared `raan_deg` of 45.0, 45.99 and 46.97, so the two fixtures agree on inclination, altitude, site, heading and epoch but not on the RAAN value. No RAAN can satisfy both, because the site passage at that instant and the declared RAAN are independent. ENGINE's real ephemeris replaces both files at G1.
2. **The launch azimuth is checked in the inertial frame, and the rotating frame value is reported.** Spec II.2 gives cos(i) = cos(phi_s) sin(beta) for the inertial azimuth, and the fixture reproduces it to 0.0001 deg. The ground track heading of the same instant in the rotating frame is 194.1591 deg, 2.6036 deg larger, because the Earth turns under the vehicle during the ascent. Spec II.6 reports both, so the script checks the first and prints both rather than asserting the rotating frame value equals the inertial one.
3. **The injection offset is exactly 600 s and is an ASSUMPTION.** The instruction for this session fixed it, and it is a vehicle parameter that belongs to ENGINE at `backend/engine/data/vehicles/cyclone4m.json`, which does not exist on this branch. The number is the fixture's, and the screen names the owner.
4. **The window table CSV is read from the rendered table.** That is the literal reading of the acceptance test, and it makes the file the table the planner saw. The JSON download is the untouched response, so the exact values are still available without parsing a formatted string. The test compares the exported rows with the rendered rows cell by cell, and separately with the formatted values of the response row.
5. **The vehicle duration needed a screen to live on.** F8 asks for the slide bonus to be surfaced as the `liftoff_instant_error_min` number. That number is in the response but was in no table, so Screen 5 prints it per row beside `window_center_shift_s` and the ascent interval, with a test. The window table of Screen 1 keeps the eight spec V.1 columns unchanged.
6. **The schema check in the script is a documented subset, proved on every run.** `jsonschema` is not importable from the standard library, so the script implements the keywords the frozen schemas use and lists them in `SchemaSet.SUPPORTED`, printing a warning for any keyword it does not implement. It is proved non-vacuous by requiring, on every run, that it accepts all the good examples and rejects all the bad examples of the five fixture schemas, 42 files, which are the same examples the contract suite checks with jsonschema.
7. **The fixture set has a corridor conflict that is reported, not patched.** `backend/fixtures/site.json` declares corridor bounds of 100 to 140 deg marked `VERIFIED`; `backend/fixtures/windows.json` declares 90 to 200 marked `ASSUMPTION` for the same site; spec II.3 states the default corridor file ships 90 to 200. With bounds of 100 to 140 the reachable inclination tops out near 63 deg, so the 191.6 deg southbound SSO azimuth cannot satisfy them, and the Screen 2 guard consequently flags the correct southbound fixture track as leaving the corridor. The instruction for this session was to regenerate `windows.json` and `ephemeris.json` and to keep every other field of every other fixture, so `site.json` was not touched and no value was invented. The bounds are ENGINE data in `backend/engine/data/site_canso.json`, absent on this branch. This needs ENGINE or API.
8. **The offline test blocks the network rather than stubbing the loader.** Every URL under `API_BASE` is refused with a failed fetch and only a repository file can answer, so the test exercises the same code path a browser takes with the server down, including the fixture URLs resolved from `FIXTURE_BASE`.
9. **The clock is pinned in the offline test.** The fixture liftoffs are in October 2026, so asserting an exact countdown reading against `Date.now()` would expire. `vi.setSystemTime` fixes the clock and makes the assertion exact without weakening it: the value is still computed from the clock against the ISO string, and the tick still has to fire for the second reading to change.
10. **The provenance panel reads `constants_block.citation_id` as the config hash.** No field of the frozen schemas is named `config_hash`, so the run identifier that spec IV says is resolvable through `GET /v1/citation` is shown as the config hash, with the resolution route named. No new field was invented.
11. **One row of the requirements map is NOT DONE.** The slide line "a missed window can cost millions" is quantified as expected delay cost in spec II.9 (iv) and VI.3, in the decision layer, which is ENGINE's, and no frozen schema field carries a cost. Nothing was invented in the browser, so the row names no test and is marked NOT DONE.
12. **The verdict line of the analysis screen states the claim status.** The PROVED, SKETCHED and CONJECTURE marks of spec II.9 are printed next to the skill series, so a viewer cannot read positive Brier skill as a theorem.

# Session covering the Screen 4 viewing fix (issue 5, F5)

Summary: the visibility of Screen 4 is now computed over the ascent of the selected window only, from the samples inside `[t_liftoff_utc, t_injection_utc]`, with the position at both endpoints interpolated when fewer than two samples fall inside, over a `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_DEG = 5` threshold flagged ASSUMPTION, and the centres are ranked by that maximum so the screen names the best view. An ephemeris that does not reach the ascent now says so and marks no centre visible. Six cases were added to `tests/viewing.test.js`, two existing cases were adjusted, and none was weakened.

## Commands run

```text
$ cd frontend && npx vitest run
```

First run, after the geometry change and before the test file was touched, to record the red state of the two cases that asserted the old all-samples behaviour and the old mask wording:

```text
 Test Files  1 failed | 8 passed (9)
      Tests  2 failed | 49 passed (51)
AssertionError: expected '1Halifax, Nova Scotia44.6488-63.57529…' to contain 'visible above the 10 deg mask'
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'vehicle_sunlit')
```

Final run:

```text
$ cd frontend && npx vitest run
```

```text
 Test Files  9 passed (9)
      Tests  57 passed (57)
   Duration  1.29s (environment 53%, tests 35%, transform 8%, import 4%)
```

Per file during development: `npx vitest run tests/viewing.test.js` reported 12 passed.

## Files changed

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/config.js` | Added `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_DEG` of 5 with `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_FLAG` and `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_SOURCE`. `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG` and its flag and source are untouched |
| `frontend/src/viewing.js` | `ascentSamples()`, which restricts the ephemeris to the ascent of the selected row, interpolates the liftoff and injection positions between bracketing samples and reports coverage; `NO_ASCENT_COVERAGE`; `viewingReport()` gained `ascent` and `minElevationDeg`, reports the ascent window, the samples used, the interpolated count and the coverage message, ranks `report.centres` by max elevation with a `rank` per centre, takes `best_centre` as the top visible centre, and each sample now carries `index` and `interpolated`. `earthRadiusOf`, `topocentric` and `centreEntries` are unchanged |
| `frontend/src/screens/viewing.js` | Reads the selected row and passes its ascent interval, memoises on it, adds `p#viewing-ascent-note` and `p#viewing-min-elevation-note`, a rank column, `data-rank`, `data-best`, `data-peak-t-utc` and `data-peak-sunlit-in-darkness` on every row, names `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_DEG` in the verdict text, and reports the missing coverage in the status, the sub line and the ascent note |
| `frontend/tests/viewing.test.js` | Six cases added, two adjusted, none weakened |
| `frontend/README.md` | The Screen 4 geometry section rewritten as eight numbered steps, with the ascent rule first, the two thresholds separated, the ranking and the best view stated, and a paragraph on what the shipped fixtures show through the new rule. Both test tables updated |
| `frontend/DONE.md` | The Screen 4 row and the recorded test count |
| `frontend/REQUIREMENTS_MAP.md` | The viewing map row, with the six new case names and the components they cover |
| `docs/log/frontend.md` | This section |

## Test to requirement map

| Requirement | Test |
|---|---|
| Visibility is computed over the ascent of the selected row, so a centre far from the ascent is not counted | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `does not count a centre that only the samples outside the ascent can see`: the same track puts Montreal at 90 deg and visible when every sample counts, and below the horizon and not visible once the ascent interval is applied, at the screen and in `viewingReport` |
| Samples outside `[t_liftoff_utc, t_injection_utc]` are ignored | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `ignores every sample outside the ascent interval of the selected row`: `sample_count` 3, `ascent_sample_count` 2, and every sample of every centre inside the interval with its peak time inside it |
| The liftoff and injection positions are interpolated when fewer than two samples fall inside | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `interpolates the liftoff and injection positions when fewer than two samples fall inside the ascent`: two bracketing samples, two interpolated endpoints, both flagged, liftoff at the midpoint of the bracketing latitude and longitude |
| A centre is visible only at or above `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_DEG`, labelled ASSUMPTION on screen | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `honours the configured minimum elevation of the ascent`: St. Johns at 4.400 deg is not visible at the configured 5 and visible at an injected 4, `best_centre_id` follows, and the screen note carries the value, the flag and the source name |
| Centres are ranked by max elevation, descending, with the max elevation, its UTC time and the sunlit flag, and the best view is the top visible centre | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `ranks the centres by the maximum elevation of the ascent and calls the best view`: the report elevations are sorted descending, the ranks are 1 to 7, each peak time is the time of its maximum sample, the rendered rows carry the rank order with one `data-best`, and the chart note names the best view |
| A missing ephemeris coverage shows the message and marks no centre visible | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `says the ephemeris does not cover the ascent and marks no centre visible`: `coverage_message`, `ascent_covered` false, no best centre, the sentence in the ascent note, the sub line and the status, `visible centres 0 of 7`, and every row not visible with no elevation |
| The existing F5 cases still hold | `tests/viewing.test.js` first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth cases unchanged and passing, plus `tests/offline.test.js` |

## Interpretations and open points

1. **The ascent endpoints are interpolated, never clamped.** When fewer than two samples fall inside the ascent, the position at liftoff and at injection is interpolated linearly between the samples that bracket each instant. When the ephemeris has no sample on both sides of one of the two instants, the coverage fails and the screen says `Ephemeris does not cover the ascent of this window` rather than holding a position from far outside the ascent at the endpoint instant. Holding the nearest sample would have reported an invented position as an observation, and the phrase "at all" in the instruction is read as covering this case.
2. **`ELEVATION_MASK_DEG = 10` and `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_DEG = 5` are two different numbers and both stay.** The verdict uses the new minimum of 5, because the slide asks which regions have the best view of the ascent and a 10 deg mask on a 10 minute ascent hides the low passes that the answer depends on. The 10 deg mask of spec V.4 stays what the specification calls it, the reference line drawn on the elevation chart, and its ASSUMPTION note is unchanged. Nothing about the chart changed.
3. **Two existing cases were adjusted, and neither was weakened.** `reports whether the vehicle is sunlit while an observer is in darkness` used a single ephemeris sample at 09:30 UTC, four hours before the ascent of the stub row, which the old all-samples code used and the new code must not. The row is shifted so that its ascent brackets that instant, the sample is replaced by the two samples that bracket it, and the assertions are unchanged in kind and stricter in extent: both ascent samples of every centre are asserted sunlit with a dark observer, so the count is 2 rather than 1. `shows visibility with an elevation number for a centre geometrically in view` asserted the verdict string `visible above the 10 deg mask`, which would now be a false statement on screen, so it asserts `visible above the 5 deg minimum elevation`; its elevation number, its `>= ELEVATION_MASK_DEG` check, its chart point and its mask line assertions are untouched.
4. **The rows are rendered in rank order, so the report order is the ranking.** `report.centres` is sorted by max elevation descending, with centres that have no ascent sample last and ties broken by id. The elevation chart is drawn for the top visible centre, and when no centre reaches the minimum the screen says so instead of drawing a series for a centre that is not visible.
5. **The shipped ephemeris fixture covers one row of three.** `backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` spans two orbital periods from the first liftoff of 5 Oct, so only the 11 samples inside the 10 minute ascent of the first row count, and the rows of 6 and 7 Oct now state the coverage sentence. The old screen borrowed the first row's geometry for those rows. No fixture was changed, and ENGINE's per row ephemeris replaces it at G1.
6. **Nothing personal or unverifiable was invented.** The only new number is the 5 deg minimum elevation of issue F5, which is in `src/config.js` with its flag and source and is printed on the screen.

## Not done in this session

The 3D globe stays cut, the elevation mask of spec V.4 is not replaced anywhere else, no fixture, schema or backend file was touched, no package was installed, nothing was committed, and no file outside `frontend/` and this log was created or edited.

# Session covering the two Screen 4 follow-ups (issue 5, F5)

Summary: one threshold instead of two, `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG = 10` of spec V.4, and a fixture that models the ascent instead of starting the vehicle at 550 km on the pad. With the regenerated ephemeris the first window now answers the slide question with one region, Halifax, instead of every city on the list.

## Visible centres of the first window after the fix

Ascent `2026-10-05T11:42:17Z` to `2026-10-05T11:52:17Z`, 21 of the 202 ephemeris samples, threshold `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG = 10`:

| Rank | Centre | Max elevation over the ascent | Time of max | Visible |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Halifax, Nova Scotia | 14.05 deg at 11:44:47Z, 263 km | yes |
| 2 | Sydney, Nova Scotia | 8.85 deg at 11:44:17Z, 281 km | no |
| 3 | Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island | 8.24 deg at 11:44:47Z, 396 km | no |
| 4 | Moncton, New Brunswick | 7.33 deg at 11:45:17Z, 537 km | no |
| 5 | Boston, Massachusetts | 6.33 deg at 11:46:47Z, 922 km | no |
| 6 | Montreal, Quebec | 1.67 deg at 11:46:47Z, 1291 km | no |
| 7 | St. Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador | 1.29 deg at 11:45:47Z, 1076 km | no |

Visible centres 1 of 7, best view Halifax. The Halifax elevation series reads 4.1 deg one minute after liftoff, 12.7 deg at 11:44:17Z, 13.3 deg at 11:45:17Z, then falls through zero at 11:49:17Z, which is the shape of a vehicle climbing away to the south: a rise, a shallow peak, then the horizon. No centre sees a sunlit vehicle while in darkness at any ascent sample of this window. The rows of 6 and 7 Oct are still outside the span of the shipped ephemeris and state the coverage sentence.

## Files changed

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/config.js` | `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_DEG`, `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_FLAG` and `VIEWING_MIN_ELEVATION_SOURCE` removed. `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG = 10` with its flag and source is the only threshold and is unchanged |
| `frontend/src/viewing.js` | `viewingReport` lost `minElevationDeg` and the `min_elevation_deg` field; the verdict is `max elevation >= elevationMaskDeg` again. The ascent restriction, the interpolation, the coverage message, the ranking and the best view of the previous session are unchanged |
| `frontend/src/screens/viewing.js` | The `minElevationDeg` option, `p#viewing-min-elevation-note` and its `data-min-elevation-deg` removed. The verdict badge, the empty chart note and the map legend name the mask again. The ascent note, the rank column and the coverage sentence are unchanged |
| `frontend/tests/viewing.test.js` | Six cases edited to the single threshold: `honours the configured elevation mask` injects `elevationMaskDeg: 4` instead of `minElevationDeg: 4` and asserts `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG`, `elevation_mask_deg` and `#elevation-mask-note`; the in view case asserts `visible above the 10 deg mask` as it did before. No case was added, removed or weakened |
| `frontend/tools/make_fixtures.py` | The ascent is modelled between liftoff and injection and the orbit continues after it. Added `great_circle_km`, `destination_point`, `orbit_subpoint`, `downrange_at_injection_km`, `ascent_altitude_km`, `ascent_downrange_km`, the constants `ASCENT_SAMPLE_STEP_S`, `ASCENT_ALTITUDE_EXPONENT`, `ASCENT_DOWNRANGE_EXPONENT` and `DOWNRANGE_INTEGRATION_STEP_S`, the two sample grids in `build_ephemeris`, and the profile, grid, pad and handover guards in `main`. The plane solve, the window rows, the schema subset check and the self check are unchanged |
| `backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` | Regenerated: 202 samples, 21 on the 30 s ascent grid from 0 km at liftoff to 550 km at injection, then 181 on the unchanged 60 s orbit grid to the end of the second revolution. `orbit_id`, `frame`, `ground_track_valid` and the `constants_block` are carried over |
| `backend/fixtures/windows.json` | Rewritten by the generator with identical content, because `build_windows` restates the same three rows. `git status` shows no change to it |
| `frontend/README.md` | Geometry step 5 back to one threshold, and the two fixture paragraphs rewritten: the generator paragraph names the two profiles, `D`, the new guards, the handover gap and the 202 samples; the Screen 4 paragraph states the new outcome, Halifax as the only centre |
| `frontend/DONE.md`, `frontend/REQUIREMENTS_MAP.md` | The Screen 4 rows name the elevation mask again, and the map row carries the same ten test names |
| `docs/log/frontend.md` | This section |

## Test to requirement map

| Requirement | Test |
|---|---|
| One visibility threshold, `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG = 10` | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `honours the configured elevation mask`: `elevation_mask_deg` is the configured value, St. Johns at 4.400 deg is not visible at it and visible at an injected 4, `best_centre_id` follows, and the screen note carries the value with its ASSUMPTION flag and the `ELEVATION_MASK_DEG` source name |
| The verdict names the threshold it uses | `tests/viewing.test.js` / `shows visibility with an elevation number for a centre geometrically in view`: the row reads `visible above the 10 deg mask` and the chart still draws `data-elevation-mask-deg` 10 |
| The ascent is modelled instead of starting at 550 km | `tests/offline.test.js` reads the regenerated `backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` from disk and renders all five screens from it, and `tests/viewing.test.js` / `ignores every sample outside the ascent interval of the selected row` pins the sample bookkeeping that the new grid feeds |
| The regenerated fixture stays schema valid | The generator prints all five fixture files validating, and `python -m pytest tests/contract -q` reports 70 passed on the same files |

## Interpretations and open points

1. **The downrange distance at injection is D = 4236.045 km, measured from the orbit, and it is an ASSUMPTION.** `D` was not given a number, so it is defined as the ground distance the solved circular orbit covers in the 600 s from liftoff, integrated from its sub-points at 1 s. That choice makes the modelled ascent the same length as the arc the orbit flies, which is the only definition that ties the two parts of the fixture together. It is a fixture value, not a claim about the vehicle: it implies an average ground speed of about 7.1 km/s during the ascent, which no launcher flies, and the two profile exponents 1.5 and 2 are no less arbitrary. All three are named as ASSUMPTIONs in the script header, in the printed output and here.
2. **The ascent and the orbit do not meet exactly at the handover, and that is reported, not hidden.** The ascent follows `azimuth_compass_deg` of 188.9 deg from the site, which is a great circle, while the sub-satellite track of the orbit curves and carries a bearing of 194.16 deg at liftoff rising to 195.54 deg at injection. The two paths are therefore about 456 km apart at injection. The generator prints that gap on every run and refuses to write if it exceeds a fifth of `D`, which is a bound against a broken downrange model rather than a claim of continuity. Making the two parts meet exactly would mean letting the ascent follow the orbit track instead of the compass azimuth of the window row, which is a different model from the one asked for, so it was not done silently.
3. **The orbital grid after the handover is unchanged, so the file keeps its end.** The ascent occupies 0 to 600 s at 30 s and the orbit resumes at 660 s on the 60 s grid it always used, so every sample the old file carried after 600 s is still there and the last sample is still `2026-10-05T14:53:17Z`.
4. **The old altitude guard became two guards.** "A circular orbit must hold altitude" no longer holds for the whole track, so it is checked over the orbit after injection only, and the ascent is checked against its own profile, its 30 s grid, and a first sample of 0 km over the site.
5. **A stale README claim was found and not fixed.** The known conflicts section states that `site.json` declares corridor bounds of 100 to 140 deg against 90 to 200 deg in `windows.json`. Both shipped fixtures actually declare 90 to 200, so that paragraph no longer describes the files, and the Screen 2 guard flags 126 of the 202 samples of the new track as outside those bounds, which is the orbit leaving the fan rather than the bounds disagreement. It is outside the two follow-ups, so it is left for the next session rather than edited here.
6. **Nothing personal or unverifiable was invented.** The only new numbers are the two profile exponents, the 30 s ascent step and `D`, and every one of them is stated in the script, printed on every run and recorded here.

## Not done in this session

The frozen contract examples were not regenerated, so `tests/contract/examples/good/ephemeris_response_good_leo45.json` still carries the two-sample track at 550 km that the viewing tests use as an explicit input, which is correct because those tests are about the browser, not about the fixture. No schema was changed, no package was installed, nothing was committed, and no file outside `frontend/`, `backend/fixtures/*.json` and this log was created or edited.

## Fixture generator change made during integration (4 October 2026)

Made on the branch `feature-weather-validation` by the WEATHER workflow at the repository owner's request.

- `frontend/tools/make_fixtures.py` now restates two things it used to carry over from the frozen files. The
  weather fields of the three window rows (`p_success`, `p_success_components.weather`, `horizon_label`,
  `forecast_issue_time`) come from `backend/fixtures/weather.json`, which WEATHER generates. The constants of
  `windows.json` and `ephemeris.json` come from `backend/api/data/constants.json`.
- Reason: `windows.json` carried the weather probability 0.36 and issue time 09:00Z of the earlier hand-typed
  weather stand-in, and both files carried `J2: 0.000108262668`, a tenth of the spec II.10 value.
- Result after regeneration: weather 0.7058823529411765, `FORECAST`, issue time 2026-10-03T12:00:00Z on the three
  rows; `J2: 0.00108262668` in both files. Nothing else in either file changed, and a second run changes nothing.
- `npx vitest run` under Node 22: 9 files, 57 tests passed. Node 20.15 cannot start the suite (jsdom 30 needs
  `require` of an ES module).
