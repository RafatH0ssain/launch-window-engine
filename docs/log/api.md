# API workflow log

Appended after every task, as required by `docs/00_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md` section 8, so that a
session restart loses nothing.

## G0 contract

Issue: `docs/issues/issue-01-CONTRACT.md`, "[CONTRACT][G0] Freeze the /v1 API contract".
Date of this entry: 3 October 2026. Status: schemas written, contract suite green, nothing committed
and nothing tagged by this session. The tag `g0-contract-frozen` and the issue comment are still
outstanding and are listed under item 27 below.

### What shipped

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tests/contract/schemas/windows_request.json` | POST /v1/windows request body, spec IV.1 |
| `tests/contract/schemas/windows_response.json` | POST /v1/windows response body, spec IV.1 |
| `tests/contract/schemas/constants_block.json` | shared constants object, spec IV |
| `tests/contract/schemas/provenance_block.json` | shared provenance object, spec IV |
| `tests/contract/schemas/ephemeris_response.json` | GET /v1/orbits/{id}/ephemeris, spec IV.2 |
| `tests/contract/schemas/weather_probability_response.json` | GET /v1/weather/probability, spec IV.3 |
| `tests/contract/schemas/skill_response.json` | GET /v1/validation/skill, spec IV.4 |
| `tests/contract/schemas/site_response.json` | GET /v1/site, spec IV.5 |
| `tests/contract/examples/good/*.json` | 20 accepted examples, at least 2 per schema |
| `tests/contract/examples/bad/*.json` | 43 rejected examples, at least 3 per schema, one broken rule each |
| `tests/contract/test_schemas.py` | schema validity, example acceptance and rejection, auto-discovered |
| `pyproject.toml` | package `launchwin` 0.1.0, python >=3.11, runtime deps, dev extra, pytest testpaths |
| `backend/__init__.py`, `backend/api/__init__.py` | empty package markers so that setuptools discovers `backend*` |

Nothing outside those paths was created or edited. `docs/00_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md` was already in
the repository, so definition-of-done item 5 of the issue is satisfied by the existing file.

### Commands run and their output

Contract suite, the G0 acceptance command:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract -q
......................................................................   [100%]
70 passed in 0.07s
```

Whole repository with the configured testpaths, which proves `testpaths = ["tests", "backend"]`
resolves and that the empty `backend` package collects nothing yet:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
......................................................................   [100%]
70 passed in 0.07s
```

Per bad example rejection audit, showing that every bad example is rejected and that each one
breaks a single rule (the site car_references case reports two array items of the same rule):

### Interpretations

Every place where the specification was ambiguous, or where it differs from the issue field list.
The specification is authoritative; where it differs from the issue, the specification wins and the
difference is recorded here.

1. **Site geometry field names, spec against issue.** Spec IV.5 names the geometry `phi_s_deg`,
   `lambda_s_deg`, `h_s_m`. The issue names them `name, lat, lon, alt_m`. The schema freezes the spec
   names, so `lat`, `lon` and `alt_m` are not in the contract. `name` is kept because neither source
   contradicts it and no spec name exists for a site identifier. ENGINE must emit `phi_s_deg`,
   `lambda_s_deg`, `h_s_m`.
2. **Skill response is larger in the spec than in the issue.** Spec IV.4 carries `roc_points`,
   `skill_horizon_measured_days` and `constants_block`; the issue field list omits all three. All
   three are frozen and required. WEATHER's `hindcast` output must therefore include them.
3. **`verification_source` and `reference_forecast`.** Spec IV.4 writes them as single quoted values
   (`"era5"`, `"climatology_base_rate"`) rather than as unions, so they are frozen as single value
   enums. Widening either is a schema change announced through Seam 2, not a silent edit.
4. **`site` on the weather response.** Spec IV.3 writes `"site": "canso"`, but IV.1 takes a site id
   from configuration and IV.7 rule 2 reserves 404 for an unknown site id. A single value enum would
   make that 404 unreachable, so the field is a string with `"default": "canso"` and its value is not
   frozen.
5. **`constants_block.source`.** The spec block lists six fields and no `source`; the issue adds
   `source: { each constant: source document }`. The issue reading is kept, because requirement 1 and
   spec II.10 need a per constant source, and the block is written `{...}` in the issue so the map
   itself stays open (`additionalProperties: true`). `source` is required, the keys inside it are not
   frozen.
6. **Required set of `windows_request`.** The spec gives defaults for `site`, `criteria_version`,
   `raan_tolerance_deg` and `include_weather`, so a client may omit them and they are not required.
   `corridor` is marked optional in the spec and stays optional. `target`, `date_range` and
   `vehicle_profile_id` are required.
7. **CUSTOM target rule.** `type` is the only unconditional member of `target`. `h_t_km` and
   `i_t_deg` are required and non-null only when `type` is `CUSTOM`, encoded with `if` on
   `type == CUSTOM` and `then` requiring both as `number`. Two bad examples cover the absent case and
   the null case. `raan_deg` and `ltan_hours` stay nullable for every target type.
8. **`ltan_hours` carries no pattern.** The spec gives `"10:30"` as an example only. A pattern would
   be an invented constraint, so the field is `string | null`.
9. **No conditional on `reachable`.** Spec IV.1 says `plane_change_dv_ms` is non-null when
   `reachable` is false and the penalty is computable, so it may be null on an unreachable result. No
   if/then links the two fields, because one would contradict the spec.
10. **Empty `windows`.** The `windows` array has no `minItems`. Spec IV.1 semantics make an empty
    array with `reachable: true` an informative result, not an error, and it is frozen as valid and
    asserted in `test_empty_windows_with_reachable_true_is_a_valid_result`.
11. **`p_success_components.range` and `.conjunction`.** Spec IV.1 types them as `number` with the
    comment "0 or 1 (pre-screen, II.8)". They are frozen as numbers in [0, 1] with
    `minimum`/`maximum` rather than as the two value enum 0 or 1, per the contract task, so a
    pre-screen probability that is not exactly binary is still expressible.
12. **Numeric ranges the spec does not state.** Frozen as definitional, not as physics:
    `lat_deg` in [-90, 90] and `lon_deg` in [-180, 180] on ephemeris points, `base_rate`, `bs`,
    `bs_ref`, `p_center`, `observed_freq`, `pod` and `far` in [0, 1], `n_cases`, `n`, `roc_points`
    counts and the site `car_references` items as strings, `n_cases` and `n` as non-negative
    integers, and `lead_time_days` at or above 0. `bss` is left unbounded because Brier skill
    score is signed.
13. **The constants themselves are not frozen as values.** `J2`, `GM`, `R_e` and `omega_sid_rad_s`
    are typed as `number` with the spec values shown in `description`. Freezing them with `const`
    would turn a corrected constant into a contract break, and the spec requires constants to come
    from configuration rather than from source.
14. **`site_response` is left open.** Spec IV.5 enumerates the body in prose (coordinate variants
    with sources, EA reference URLs, launch rate cap, corridor polygon vertices) without giving field
    names. The root object therefore stays open (`additionalProperties: true`) instead of inventing
    names. `corridor` inside it is closed, because the issue gives its four fields.
15. **`operating_hours` is untyped in both sources.** Spec IV.5 says "nominal operating hours
    (07:00-12:00 local)" and the issue gives only the name. The schema admits `string | object` and
    the ambiguity is recorded rather than resolved by invention. Both good site examples show one
    shape each.
16. **`car_references` values are not frozen.** The spec names 602.43 and 602.44 and both good
    examples carry them, but the array holds plain strings so that citing a further regulation does
    not break the contract.
17. **Objects the spec writes as bare `object` or `{...}`.** Left open with
    `additionalProperties: true`: `windows_response.sso_consistency_warning`,
    `constants_block.source`, and `provenance_block.site`, `provenance_block.corridor` and
    `provenance_block.row_flags`. Their contents are owned by ENGINE and WEATHER.
18. **`additionalProperties: false` scope.** Applied to `windows_request` and its `target`,
    `date_range` and `corridor`; to `windows_response` and each window, `p_success_components` and
    `screens`; to `ephemeris_response` and each point; to every array item of
    `weather_probability_response`; to `skill_response` and its `period`, `skill_series` items,
    `reliability_bins` items and `roc_points` items; to `constants_block` and `provenance_block`;
    and to `site_response.corridor`. Left open only where item 14 and item 17 say so.
19. **`engine_version` is a free string.** The issue rule that stub output carries
    `"engine_version": "stub"` is a convention, not an enumeration, so no value set is frozen. The
    stub is asserted by `test_stub_responses_are_distinguishable` and shown by the good example
    `windows_response_good_stub.json`.
20. **`date-time` enforcement had to be supplied.** The pinned jsonschema 4.26.0 in `.venv` ships a
    `date` checker but no `date-time` checker, because that one needs the optional
    rfc3339-validator package, which is absent and may not be installed. `test_schemas.py`
    therefore registers an equivalent strict check on a `FormatChecker` instance
    (`FormatChecker.checks`), requiring ISO-8601 with a `Z` or numeric offset suffix as spec IV.1
    demands, and only when the built-in checker is missing. If rfc3339-validator is ever installed,
    the built-in checker wins. Verified load bearing: without the format checker
    `windows_response_bad_t_liftoff_utc_format.json` validates, so the suite would be vacuous
    without it.
21. **Reference resolution.** Each schema carries `"$id"` equal to its file name, and
    `test_schemas.py` builds a `referencing.Registry` from every schema file, so
    `"$ref": "constants_block.json"` and `"$ref": "provenance_block.json"` resolve without any
    network retrieval. `test_shared_objects_are_referenced_and_never_copied` asserts that the shared
    fields are never declared inline anywhere else.
22. **Package name.** The issue and `docs/03_WORKFLOW_API.md` ask for the project name `launchwin`,
    while spec IV.9 names the client package `c2window`. `pyproject.toml` uses `launchwin` as
    instructed. The client import name for task A8 remains open and needs a decision before A8.
23. **Schema count.** The issue says "six endpoints" and "six schemas" and then lists eight schema
    files. The eight listed files are delivered. Spec IV.6 `/v1/citation` is deliberately not
    frozen here, because it is not in this issue's file list; see item 27.
24. **`skill_response` has no `lead_max` echo.** The spec takes `lead_max=10` as a query parameter
    and does not echo it in the body, so no field was added for it.
25. **Example values are illustrative.** All numeric values in the examples are placeholders that
    demonstrate the shape. Corridor azimuth bounds, the citation id and the skill series numbers
    carry no claim. No citation was invented: `constants_block.source` in the examples points at the
    spec II.10 constants table rather than at a literature reference, because citation resolution is
    by title through Crossref and is not this task's work.
26. **`pip install -e .` was not verified.** `setuptools` is not installed in `.venv` and installing
    it is not permitted here, so the build backend was exercised only by writing a conventional
    `pyproject.toml` with `backend*` package discovery. Definition-of-done item 3 of the issue is
    therefore unverified by execution and must be checked in a clean venv before the gate is called
    done. `pytest tests/contract/` is proved green.
27. **Left undone, deliberately.** Tag `g0-contract-frozen`, the push, and the issue comment quoting
    the tag SHA with this interpretation list. Committing and tagging were outside the instructions
    given for this session. Also not delivered: a schema for `GET /v1/citation` (spec IV.6), which
    this issue does not list, and the consumer tests `tests/contract/test_engine_schema.py` and
    `tests/contract/test_weather_schema.py`, which are the obligation of ENGINE and WEATHER under
    Seam 2 and not of this issue.
### Update to interpretation 26
`pip install -e .` verified by the lead: `uv venv` in a fresh temp dir, `uv pip install -e .`, then `python -c "import backend.api, fastapi, httpx, pydantic, uvicorn"` run from `/tmp` printed `install ok`.

## A1-A3 provenance, app skeleton and the stubbed window route

Issue: `docs/issues/issue-04-API.md`, tasks A1, A2 and A3 only. A4 to A11 are untouched and
nothing was committed by this session. The test suite is written before the code it tests; the
red observations are quoted below in the order they happened.

### What shipped

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/api/provenance.py` | `constants_block`, `provenance_block`, the deterministic `citation_id`, the config hash, `assert_complete` |
| `backend/api/config.py` | the only reader of `backend/api/data`, and the `Settings` seam every other module takes |
| `backend/api/schemas.py` | loader for the frozen schemas under `tests/contract/schemas`, with a registry and an enforcing `date-time` format checker |
| `backend/api/errors.py` | the exception vocabulary and the spec IV.7 status mapping, each carrying the body fields its handler needs |
| `backend/api/app.py` | the FastAPI app, the `/v1` prefix, `openapi_url=/v1/openapi.json`, and `register_exception_handlers` |
| `backend/api/request_model.py` | application of the spec IV.1 request defaults |
| `backend/api/stubs.py` | the offline seam: fixture readers, target resolution, the reachability predicate of spec II.4, the plane-change penalty of spec II.5, the SSO consistency check of spec II.6, and the weather composition |
| `backend/api/routes/__init__.py`, `backend/api/routes/windows.py` | the `/v1` routers and `POST /v1/windows` |
| `backend/api/data/constants.json` | the five constants and their sources, the only place those values exist |
| `backend/api/data/service.json` | defaults, target classes, the spec II.6 inclination table, fixture paths, Retry-After durations |
| `backend/api/data/sites/canso.json` | site geometry, corridor, CAR references and row flags, until ENGINE lands its own file |
| `backend/api/tests/test_provenance.py` | A1, 36 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_error_model.py` | A2, 39 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_windows.py` | A3 and the requested additions, 24 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_fixtures.py` | every fixture against its frozen schema, 15 tests |
| `backend/fixtures/windows.json` | shape-complete stub response, three SSO windows from Canso, `engine_version` stub |
| `backend/fixtures/weather.json`, `skill.json`, `site.json`, `ephemeris.json` | copies of the most complete good examples |

`backend/fixtures/__init__.py` was not created: the fixtures are read by path, not imported, so a
package marker would be unused.

### Commands run and their output

The first run of the A1 tests, before any of the modules existed:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_provenance.py -q
ImportError while loading conftest '.../backend/api/tests/conftest.py'.
backend/api/tests/conftest.py:11: in <module>
    from backend.api.app import create_app
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend.api.app'
1 error in 0.35s
```

The A2 and A3 tests in place, after the modules existed but before two defects were fixed (the
reachable inclination band was built with its endpoints the wrong way round, and one test referred
to a renamed attribute):

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests -q
3 failed, 72 passed, 1 warning in 0.14s
```

The A3 tests, before the route reported the offline documents it had read:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_windows.py -q
1 failed, 22 passed, 1 skipped, 1 warning in 0.09s
```

The fixture tests, before the fixture set was complete:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_fixtures.py -q
2 failed, 13 passed, 1 warning in 0.03s
```

The API suite, the acceptance command for this issue:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api -q
113 passed, 1 skipped, 1 warning in 0.20s
```

The contract suite, unchanged by this session and still green:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract -q
70 passed in 0.08s
```

The whole repository with the configured testpaths, which is the done condition:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
183 passed, 1 skipped, 1 warning in 0.52s
```

The one skip is `test_the_live_engine_path_produces_schema_valid_output`, gated on
`backend.engine.compute_windows` existing, per the A3 instruction to skip gracefully until ENGINE
lands. Its mirror image, `test_the_stub_is_the_served_path_until_the_engine_lands`, is the one that
runs today and asserts `engine_version == "stub"`.

The application object imports the way uvicorn will import it:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -c "from backend.api.app import app; print(app.title)"
Launch window decision engine
```

### Interpretations

Numbering continues from the G0 list above.

28. **The service validates against `tests/contract/schemas` at run time.** Seam 2 makes those files
    the contract for everyone, so `backend/api/schemas.py` loads them rather than keeping a second
    copy that could drift. The directory is `LAUNCHWIN_CONTRACT_DIR` if set, otherwise the
    repository path. The consequence, stated plainly: the deployed service reads that directory, so
    a deployment must ship it. A copy under `backend/api/data/contract` was deliberately not made,
    because two copies of a frozen contract is the drift risk the freeze exists to prevent.
29. **`citation_id` is hashed over the effective request.** The hash input is the request after the
    spec IV.1 defaults have been applied, the constants including their recorded sources, and the
    whole service configuration. The consequence is deliberate: a request that omits `site` and the
    same request that states `site: "canso"` produce the same identifier, because they are the same
    run. `test_the_same_request_with_and_without_a_default_gives_the_same_citation_id` asserts it.
30. **The date part of `citation_id` is the request start, never the clock.** `run_YYYYMMDD_` where
    the date is `date_range.start` with the hyphens removed, followed by the first twelve hexadecimal
    characters of the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON (sorted keys, no insignificant whitespace) of
    request, constants and configuration. Spec IV shows the shape `run_20261003_...`, which is a
    different date from any request in the frozen examples; the specification is a shape, not a
    promise to stamp today's date, and a clock-derived identifier could not be reproduced.
31. **A corridor bound supplied in the request is recorded as unsourced.** Spec II.10 wants a source
    for every value. A bound that arrived in the request has no citation, so the bound takes the
    value from the request, the corridor `source` string says so, and its `row_flags` entry becomes
    `UNSOURCED_REQUEST_OVERRIDE` instead of the `ASSUMPTION` that was read from the site file. The
    frozen schema leaves `row_flags` open, which is what makes the extra value expressible.
32. **Three of the four weather fields cannot be null, so they take neutral values.** Spec IV.1 and
    the frozen schema type `p_success`, `p_success_components.weather` and `horizon_label` as
    non-nullable. With `include_weather` false the composition therefore sets `weather` to 1.0
    (weather imposes no penalty because it was excluded), `p_success` to the product of the two
    deterministic pre-screens `range` and `conjunction`, and `horizon_label` to `CLIMATOLOGY`, which
    is the honest label for a probability no forecast produced. `forecast_issue_time` is nullable and
    is null. This is the schema-valid neutral value the task brief asks for; the alternative,
    dropping the fields, would break the frozen response schema.
33. **The stub composes weather from the shipped snapshot.** With `include_weather` true and no
    WEATHER module, the four weather fields come from `backend/fixtures/weather.json`, whose
    `source` is `snapshot_cache`, the value spec IV.3 reserves for a recorded forecast echoed rather
    than refetched. `backend/fixtures/windows.json` is authored so that its own `p_success` is
    already that product, which makes the recomposition idempotent and is asserted by
    `test_fixture_windows_and_the_weather_snapshot_agree`.
34. **The stub returns rows only for the orbit class they describe.** The offline floor ships three
    SSO rows. Echoing an SSO row for a POLAR request would be a wrong answer dressed as a right one,
    so a resolved target whose inclination is outside `fixture_inclination_tolerance_deg` of a row's
    `reached_inclination_deg` gets the empty window list, which spec IV.1 calls an informative valid
    result. The tolerance is 0.8 deg, half the 1.6 deg span of the published inclination table across
    its 500 to 900 km range. Known limitation for FRONTEND: the POLAR preset renders "no window in
    range" until ENGINE supplies per-class rows at G1.
35. **The reachability interval is ordered by value, not as spec II.4 writes it.** Spec II.4 states
    the reachable set as `[i(A_max), i(A_min)]`. With the shipped corridor of 90 to 200 deg the map
    `i(beta) = arccos(cos(phi_s) sin(beta))` is ascending rather than descending, so the two
    endpoints are ordered by value and the set is unchanged. The result reproduces the
    specification's own check that a bound of 200 deg caps the reachable inclination at about
    104 deg: the computed upper end is 103.92 deg.
36. **The plane-change penalty is computed by the stub.** Spec IV.1 makes `plane_change_dv_ms`
    non-null when an unreachable target's penalty is computable, and spec III.5 pass criteria name
    26.8 m/s within 1 m/s. The stub computes spec II.5 exactly, `2 v_c sin(Delta_i / 2)` with
    `v_c = sqrt(GM / (R_e + h_t))` from the constants block, which gives 26.36 m/s for the advertised
    LEO 45.1 deg class at 600 km, inside the specification's tolerance. The formula is the
    specification's; the reachability verdict it accompanies is PROVED as algebraic in
    `docs/00_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md` section 5, while the magnitude belongs to ENGINE and will
    replace this value when ENGINE lands. The test asserts the specification's own criterion rather
    than the stub's number. The class altitudes that make the computation possible are transcribed
    from the spec III drift table into `service.json`, with their sources.
37. **The SSO consistency check reads a published table, and interpolation is refused.** Spec II.6
    tabulates the altitude-inclination coupling, so the table is transcribed into
    `service.json` and the stub reads the nearest row at or below the requested altitude. Nothing is
    interpolated, because an interpolated inclination would be a number the specification does not
    publish. The warning threshold is half the coarsest precision the table is quoted at, which is
    why an explicit `i_t_deg` of 98.1 at 600 km warns (the table says 97.8 at that altitude) while a
    consistent pair does not.
38. **Vehicle rows are reported as absent rather than invented.** ENGINE owns
    `backend/engine/data/vehicles/*.json`. Until it lands the API reads no vehicle rows, so
    `provenance_block.row_flags` carries only the site rows it actually read and the vehicle file is
    absent from `source_files`. The path is resolved so that the file appears by itself once
    ENGINE ships it. No row flag was fabricated to fill the block, which is the point of spec II.10.
39. **The criteria version is read from WEATHER when its file exists.** `service.json` names
    `backend/weather/data/criteria_v1.json` and the configured fallback version. While that file is
    absent the configured version is used and no criteria path is claimed in `source_files`; once
    WEATHER ships it, the version declared inside it wins and the file is listed. The criteria rows
    themselves are WEATHER's to compose at A4.
40. **The site document lives under `backend/api` until ENGINE lands its own.** The API owns
    `backend/api/data/sites/canso.json` and `Settings.site_path` prefers
    `backend/engine/data/site_canso.json` when that file exists, so the provenance block reports the
    file the engine actually reads. The corridor bounds are the spec II.3 defaults of 90 and
    200 deg with the specification's own ASSUMPTION flag, not the illustrative 100 and 140 of the
    frozen examples; the site altitude is the 0 m default of the spec II.10 row.
41. **429 and the orbit and run 404s are driven through the production handlers, not through
    endpoints that do not exist.** A2 requires those branches, but the endpoints that would raise
    them belong to A5, A6 and A7. `register_exception_handlers` is therefore a public function and
    the test builds a scratch application that calls it and then raises each exception, so the
    shipped handler code is what is asserted. The site 404 and the 503 are additionally exercised
    through the real route: an unknown site id is a 404, and an unreadable offline document is a
    503 whose body names the configured fixture path.
42. **`computation_ms` is measured and is the one field excluded from a byte comparison.** Every
    other numeric field is a pure function of the request and the configuration, which is what spec
    III.6 test 6 compares. A wall-clock duration cannot be, so the A9 determinism gate must exclude
    it rather than pretend otherwise. Recorded now so that A9 does not have to rediscover it.
43. **The stub fixture's own `citation_id` is an illustrative placeholder.** The route overwrites it
    on every response, as it overwrites both shared blocks. This is the same status as the numeric
    values of the frozen examples, recorded as interpretation 25 of the G0 list: the fixture
    demonstrates the shape and makes no claim about the value.
44. **`site_response` stays open, so `backend/fixtures/site.json` is a verbatim copy.** Spec IV.5
    enumerates the body in prose without field names, which is why the frozen schema leaves it open
    (G0 interpretation 14). The fixture therefore cannot add the EA reference URLs, the launch rate
    cap or the corridor polygon that spec IV.5 describes; A5 has to settle the names with ENGINE and
    announce any schema change through Seam 2 before this fixture gains fields.
45. **Not delivered, deliberately.** `backend/api/README.md` and `backend/api/DONE.md` are A11 and are
    not written, so the stub-versus-real statement required by the acceptance criteria of the issue
    is outstanding. There is no `GET /v1/site`, `GET /v1/weather/probability`,
    `GET /v1/validation/skill`, `GET /v1/orbits/{id}/ephemeris` or `GET /v1/citation` route; those are
    A4 to A6. There is no rate limiter, no cache and no run store; those are A6 and A7. The
    `weather.json`, `skill.json`, `site.json` and `ephemeris.json` fixtures exist because the task
    asked for the demo floor to be complete, and no endpoint reads three of them yet.
    `backend/api/data/service.json` carries `retry_after_s` values that nothing enforces until A7,
    so no test asserts a particular duration; the tests assert that the header is present and
    positive.
46. **`git status` was not clean before this session.** The working tree already carried
    `.oc-brief-contract.md` and `.oc-brief-api1.md` from the lead. Neither was edited here, and
    nothing was committed.

## A4-A7 weather, ephemeris, citation, cache and rate limits

Issue: `docs/issues/issue-04-API.md`, tasks A4, A5, A6 and A7 only. A8 to A11 are untouched and
nothing was committed by this session. Each test file was written before the module it tests, and
the red observations are quoted below in the order they happened.

### What shipped

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/api/cache.py` | the three in-memory TTL caches of spec IV.8, the cache keys, the registry; a lifetime of zero switches a cache off |
| `backend/api/limits.py` | the sliding-window per-client budget of spec IV.8, with `enabled` to switch it off |
| `backend/api/middleware.py` | the read cache wrapper and the rate-limit route dependency |
| `backend/api/weather.py` | the WEATHER seam: cache, then the live module, then the recorded document, then a 503; and the window-weather composition with its outage policy |
| `backend/api/ephemeris.py` | the propagation seam probe and its contract check, the resampler, the documented closed form, and the query contract of spec IV.2 |
| `backend/api/orbits.py` | orbit identifiers, the preset matching, the in-process registry and the resolution order |
| `backend/api/citation.py` | the stored run records, the spec II.10 table serialised, and the citation read |
| `backend/api/site.py` | the spec IV.5 body assembled from the site document that was read |
| `backend/api/publish.py` | publishing the frozen schemas in the OpenAPI document for every route |
| `backend/api/routes/weather.py`, `ephemeris.py`, `site.py`, `citation.py` | the four new routers |
| `backend/api/data/provenance_table.json` | the spec II.10 table, in configuration, because the rule of construction says a result must be traceable to a row of it |
| `backend/api/data/ephemeris/polar879.json`, `sso981.json` | recorded offline ground-track segments for the polar and sun-synchronous classes |
| `backend/api/data/service.json` | the `cache`, `rate_limit`, `skill`, `orbits`, `ephemeris`, `site` and `runs_dir` sections, each value with its source |
| `backend/api/data/runs/.gitkeep` | the marker that keeps the ignored store directory in the repository |
| `backend/api/data/ephemeris/leo45.json` | the full-revolution leo45 record, alongside `polar879.json` and `sso981.json`; see interpretation 52 |
| `backend/api/README.md` | how to run it, the endpoint table, the error model, how to get a citation id, the fixture path, and the stub-versus-real statement |
| `backend/api/tests/test_weather.py` | A4, 26 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_ephemeris.py` | A5, 57 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_site.py` | A5, 20 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_citation.py` | A6, 25 tests |
| `backend/api/tests/test_cache_and_limits.py` | A7, 38 tests |
| `.gitignore` | the store directory, except its marker |

`tests/contract/` was not touched. Its suite is unchanged and still green.

The whole repository after the A4 wiring, which caught a real determinism defect: the weather origin
was resolved once per row, so the first response listed the weather record in `source_files` and the
second, served from the cache, did not. A3's
`test_same_request_twice_gives_the_same_citation_id` caught it.

The whole repository after the A5 and A6 modules existed, before the ephemeris units were fixed. The
defects were a degrees-per-second multiplied by an argument in radians when anchoring a segment on
the site, and a modulo that mapped the last recorded sample onto the first.

The whole surface, exercised once end to end on the offline floor, which is what the A10 harness will
do: SSO 200 with three rows, POLAR 200 with the informative empty result, LEO 200 with
`reachable: false` and 26.38 m/s, site, weather, skill and all three ephemeris classes 200, a citation
with 24 items of the II.10 table, an unknown orbit 404 and a malformed body 422.

### Interpretations

Numbering continues from the G0 list and the A1-A3 list above.

46a. **Which offline documents the service reads changed in this session, and interpretation 45 is
    superseded on that point.** A4 to A7 add four readers of `backend/fixtures/`: `weather.json` on
    both the weather endpoint and the window route, `skill.json` on the validation endpoint,
    `windows.json` on the window route, as before. Two are still unread: `site.json`, because
    `GET /v1/site` is assembled from the site configuration document rather than from the demo-floor
    copy, and `ephemeris.json`, because the base tracks are API-owned records under
    `backend/api/data/ephemeris` and the demo-floor document is not a record this workflow resamples.
    Interpretation 44 of the A1-A3 list still stands for `site.json`: the frozen `site_response.json`
    leaves its root open, so the schema needs no change, but the names to settle with ENGINE are the
    ones named in interpretation 56.
47. **The chosen weather failure behaviour is that windows still return, and null is available for
    one of the four weather fields only.** The task offers "windows still return with null weather
    fields" and asks for the schema to be checked. Checked: `windows_response.json` types `p_success`,
    `p_success_components.weather` and `horizon_label` as non-nullable and leaves only
    `forecast_issue_time` nullable. So case three of the behaviour, a dead layer with nothing cached,
    sets `forecast_issue_time` to null and the other three to the neutral set already used when
    `include_weather` is false: `weather` 1.0, `p_success` the product of the two deterministic
    pre-screens, `horizon_label` CLIMATOLOGY. This is the same reading interpretation 32 reached for
    the excluded case, applied to the outage case. The choice, the reasoning and the three tests that
    hold it are in `backend/api/README.md`.
48. **A weather GET does not get the neutral fallback.** The window route cannot answer without the
    weather fields, so it degrades. The weather endpoints exist only to report weather, and a body of
    neutral values would answer a question nobody asked, so they degrade to the recorded document and
    then to a 503. A day or a verification period the record does not cover is a 503 naming the record
    rather than a 200 with the requested date printed on a forecast issued for another one. Both are
    tested; the reasoning is in the README.
49. **The weather cache key is the request, and the issue time is stored in the entry.** Spec IV.8
    keys the weather cache by date, site and source and stores `forecast_issue_time` with the entry;
    the A4 task says "cached on forecast_issue_time". Both are honoured by keying on what identifies
    the request, the date, the site and the criteria version, and carrying `forecast_issue_time` in
    the entry so that a served answer is echoed with the issue time it was produced under and is never
    presented as a fresh fetch. The criteria version joins the key because a different criteria table
    is a different answer for the same day, which
    `test_the_weather_cache_is_not_shared_across_criteria_versions` asserts.
50. **`source_files` lists the weather record only when the weather fields came from it.** A run whose
    weather fields were excluded or degraded did not read the document, and listing it anyway would be
    the provenance gap requirement 1 exists to prevent. The origin is resolved once per response, not
    once per row: resolving it per row made the first response and the second, cache-served, response
    disagree, which A3's determinism test caught. Fixed, and the fix is what makes two identical
    requests byte-identical.
51. **Spec IV.2 asks for a custom orbit id in the window response, and the frozen schema has no field
    for it.** `windows_response.json` closes `additionalProperties`, so there is nowhere in the spec
    IV.1 body for an `orbit_id`, and that schema is frozen at G0 and is not edited from here. The
    identifier is therefore recorded where the API owns it, in two places: the in-process orbit
    registry that every POST adds to, and the stored run record of A6. The ephemeris route reads both,
    so an id created by a POST resolves before and after a restart, which
    `test_a_custom_id_is_found_in_the_stored_run_record_after_a_restart` asserts. A schema change to
    add the field is a Seam 2 announcement and is not made here.
52. **`backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` is FRONTEND content and was not edited.** An earlier pass of
    this session regenerated that file as a full-revolution leo45 record. The lead corrected it:
    contract section 0 gives this workflow the `backend/fixtures/` directory and FRONTEND its content,
    and Seam 3 makes the files hand-frozen. The edit was reverted and the record now lives at
    `backend/api/data/ephemeris/leo45.json`, generated by the same closed form as `polar879.json` and
    `sso981.json`, with `ephemeris.base_tracks.leo45` in `service.json` pointing at it. All three
    records are therefore documents this workflow owns, and
    `test_every_base_track_is_a_document_this_workflow_owns` holds that every configured base track
    resolves under `backend/api/`. `backend/fixtures/ephemeris.json` stays on disk, stays
    schema-valid, and is read as the demo floor of spec V.5 and nothing else;
    `test_the_offline_fallback_document_is_still_served_as_the_demo_floor` asserts both that it is
    valid and that no base track resolves to it. `git status backend/fixtures/` is empty. The A3
    assertions over the file, schema validity and no trailing content, are untouched and green.
    What the earlier pass got right is kept: the two-point, five-minute record could not answer a
    one-day request without repeating itself, which is why a full-revolution record was needed.
53. **The ground tracks are a closed form, not propagation, and the record is where the specification
    allows one.** Spec IV.2 says propagation for the named classes uses the secular-J2 model of Part
    II and that full force models are not offered. Neither ENGINE nor that model exists, so the three
    named classes are served from recorded segments and a custom id from the same closed form at
    request time. The closed form is the ground track of a circular orbit and nothing more: latitude
    from the inclination and the argument of latitude, longitude advancing at the orbital rate less
    the Earth's, altitude constant. No J2 precession, no perturbation. It is written out in
    `backend/api/ephemeris.py` and in `backend/api/README.md`, marked as a stand-in rather than a
    claim, and it is replaced the day `backend.engine.ephemeris` lands. Every number in it comes from
    `constants.json` or from configuration.

    The delegation to `backend.engine.ephemeris` is written now and is checked before its answer is
    served: delegation alone would put an unvalidated live answer in front of a client, and a live
    answer that breaks the contract is a worse outcome than the offline floor. The seam is asked first
    and its points are validated against the frozen `ephemeris_response.json`; a seam that raises,
    answers with something that is not a track, or answers with points the contract does not describe,
    falls through to the record. Three tests hold that, and the seam's call is asserted to carry the
    orbit id, the requested instants and the requested step.
54. **A recorded segment is repeated beyond its span, and `ground_track_valid` is the flag that says
    so.** Spec IV.2 gives no instruction for a request longer than the record. Repeating the segment is
    what a ground track does; truncating it would leave the frontend map with a five-minute stub for a
    one-day request. The repetition is a property of the offline floor, the flag is false beyond the
    three-day horizon on every id, and the README says so. Two further details: the recorded interval
    is a whole number of seconds so that the resampler can land on a recorded sample exactly, and the
    instant one span after the start is the last recorded sample rather than the first, which is what
    makes `test_the_resampler_reproduces_a_recorded_segment_exactly` hold at second resolution.
55. **`leo45` cannot overfly the site, and that is reachability rather than a defect.** The extreme
    latitude of the advertised low-Earth class is south of the site latitude, so no recorded track of
    that class crosses Canso. Spec II.4 makes the same statement algebraically, and spec III.5 makes
    that class the flagship honesty case. `test_the_leo45_track_cannot_reach_the_site_latitude` asserts
    it, and the polar and sun-synchronous classes are asserted to cross the site within 0.2 deg on the
    descending branch.
56. **`/v1/site` states two gaps instead of filling them.** Spec IV.5 asks for the environmental
    assessment reference URLs and the corridor polygon vertices used by the hazard test. No value for
    either appears in the specification, in the integration contract, or in any document this workflow
    owns. An invented URL is the phantom citation requirement 1 exists to prevent, so neither is
    returned, a `spec_gaps` field says which two are absent and why, and
    `test_the_two_items_the_repository_does_not_supply_are_absent_not_invented` holds that. The names
    to settle with ENGINE are `environmental_assessment_urls` and `corridor_polygon`. The launch rate
    cap of 8 per year and the coordinate-variant source string are returned, because spec IV.5 and
    spec II.10 give their values. The frozen `site_response.json` leaves its root open, so this needs
    no schema change; the names are still a proposal for the Seam 2 conversation.
57. **The weather response cannot carry a constants block, and that is a contract gap.** Spec IV says
    the block is "always present on result-bearing responses", and requirement 1 needs it. The frozen
    `weather_probability_response.json` closes `additionalProperties` and does not list it, so
    `GET /v1/weather/probability` cannot return one without breaking the contract. The frozen schema
    wins and no block is added. A schema change to add `constants_block` to
    `weather_probability_response.json` should be proposed through Seam 2; it is raised here and
    nowhere else, because `tests/contract/` is not edited from here. The other four result-bearing
    responses all carry one: the window response and the ephemeris response have it required by their
    schemas, the skill response has it required by its schema, and the site response carries it
    because that schema is open.
58. **A citation response schema should be proposed.** Spec IV.6 has no file in the G0 issue's list
    and none exists, and `tests/contract/` is frozen, so `GET /v1/citation` is validated by
    `backend/api/tests/test_citation.py` field by field instead: the five fields spec IV.6 names, the
    seven the A6 task requires, and the five fields of every spec II.10 item. A
    `tests/contract/schemas/citation_response.json` should be proposed through Seam 2 at the next gate,
    with `record_schema`, `request`, `request_body`, `constants_sources` and `provenance_block` among
    the fields to decide. Until then this response is the one body of the service that no frozen
    schema describes.
59. **A citation identifier for a read with no date in the request carries a zero date.** The window,
    weather, skill and ephemeris reads all have a date in the request and use it, which keeps the
    identifier of a run reproducible from the run. `GET /v1/site` has none, and a clock-derived date
    could not be reproduced, so its identifier is content addressed with the date part `00000000`,
    which is not a calendar date. A reader can therefore tell a configuration read from a dated run
    without a second field, and neither kind of value is invented from the clock.
60. **A citation identifier is validated before the store is touched.** The store is looked up by path,
    so an identifier carrying a separator or a parent reference could address a document outside the
    runs directory. Such an identifier is a malformed request, 422, not a miss, which is the reading
    of spec IV.7 rule 2 that does not treat a traversal attempt as a resource question. A containment
    check on the resolved path is kept as well, so the guarantee does not rest on the pattern alone.
61. **A cache replay returns the stored body byte for byte, including `computation_ms`.** The
    alternative, rewriting the timing field on replay, would make a cached answer differ from the
    fresh one it replaces. The consequence is the one interpretation 42 recorded: the determinism
    comparison of spec III.6 test 6 excludes `computation_ms`, because a wall-clock duration is not a
    function of the request. Every other field is compared, and
    `test_a_cached_replay_is_byte_identical_including_the_timing_field` states the stronger property
    that the replay is identical, timing included.
62. **The cache hit is asserted by a counter, not by a clock.** The A7 task says identical requests
    within the lifetime "hit cache and are faster". A timing assertion is flaky on a loaded machine and
    fails for reasons that have nothing to do with this code, so the tests assert the hit and miss
    counters, which state the same fact deterministically. This is recorded because it is a deliberate
    departure from the workflow wording, not an oversight.
63. **`/v1/openapi.json` and `/v1/health` are not charged against the read budget.** A client reading
    the contract or polling for liveness is not using the research budget, and charging it would let a
    monitoring system deny service to a researcher. Both are served by the application object rather
    than by a router, so they carry neither the cache nor the limiter.
64. **The window is sliding rather than fixed.** Spec IV.8 gives a per-minute budget and does not say
    how the minute is measured. A fixed window lets a client spend a whole budget at the end of one
    minute and another at the start of the next, so the counter forgets stamps older than the window
    and the `Retry-After` names the time until the oldest stamp falls out. `retry_after_s` in the
    configuration is the value reported when the whole window is still to run.
65. **A forwarded address is a separate budget.** The service is expected to run behind a reverse proxy,
    where every request would otherwise arrive from the proxy and share one budget of 60 a minute. The
    socket address is the primary key and `X-Forwarded-For` is honoured when present. A deployment that
    does not want this can set `enabled: false` and put a limiter in front.
66. **Not delivered, deliberately.** No Python client (A8), no `scripts/integration_test.py` (A10), no
    `DONE.md` (A11). No `tests/contract/schemas/citation_response.json`, for the reason in
    interpretation 58. No vehicle row is reported, because ENGINE owns
    `backend/engine/data/vehicles/*.json` and the file does not exist; the citation reads the path so
    that the rows appear the day it does, and nothing is invented in the meantime, which is
    interpretation 38 applied to the new endpoint. No TLE is fetched and no NOTAM screen reads a live
    feed, because ENGINE owns both; the citation records that state rather than leaving a reader to
    assume a live source.
67. **`git status` was not clean before this session, and the store was verified to be ignored.** The
    working tree already carried `.oc-brief-contract.md` and `.oc-brief-api1.md` from the lead; neither
    was edited here. The root `.gitignore` gained five lines, which is outside the paths this workflow
    owns and was required by the A6 task; nothing else outside `backend/api/`,
    `backend/fixtures/` and this log was touched. `git check-ignore -v
    backend/api/data/runs/somefile.json` reports `.gitignore:8`, and
    `git status --untracked-files=all backend/api/data/runs` lists only `.gitkeep`.

## A8 the public Python client of spec IV.9

Issue: `docs/issues/issue-04-API.md`, task A8 only. A1 to A7 were already committed and
were not rewritten; A9 to A11 are untouched and nothing was committed by this session. The
tests and the client were written in one pass and the runs are quoted below in the order they
happened, the first of which is a collection error rather than a failing assertion, and the
last of which is green.

### What shipped

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/client/launchwin.py` | the six public functions of spec IV.9, the DataFrame shapes, `LaunchwinError` and the base URL resolution |
| `backend/client/__init__.py` | the in-repository package form of the same module, re-exporting the one public surface |
| `backend/api/tests/test_client.py` | A8, 54 tests, of which 52 run here and 2 skip because the distribution is not installed in this environment |
| `pyproject.toml` | `pandas` as a hard dependency, the top level `launchwin` module mapping, and the `pythonpath` entry that lets the suite import the module before it is installed |
| `docs/log/api.md` | this section |

`backend/api/**` was not modified, `tests/contract/` was not touched, and `backend/fixtures`
was not touched. `git status --short` lists the four paths above and nothing else.

The public surface, in the words of spec IV.9 plus the shapes this task named:

```python
import launchwin

frame = launchwin.windows(target="SSO", site="canso", dates=("2026-10-05", "2026-10-15"))
document = launchwin.weather("2026-10-06")
series = launchwin.skill("2026-05-01", "2026-08-31", lead_max=10)
site = launchwin.site()
track = launchwin.ephemeris("sso981", "2026-10-05T00:00:00Z", "2026-10-05T01:00:00Z")
provenance = launchwin.citation(frame.attrs["response"]["constants_block"]["citation_id"])
```

`windows` returns one row per window with the columns of `launchwin.WINDOW_COLUMNS` and the
whole spec IV.1 response in `frame.attrs["response"]`. `ephemeris` returns one row per point
with the columns of `launchwin.POINT_COLUMNS` and the whole response in
`frame.attrs["response"]`. The four reads return the response document as a JSON object.
Every function takes `base_url` and `client`; `client` is anything with the
`httpx.Client` interface, which is how a FastAPI `TestClient` is passed in.

### The packaging decision

`import launchwin` has to resolve to `backend/client/launchwin.py`, and the file has to stay
where this workflow owns it. Three things in the root `pyproject.toml` do that:

```toml
[tool.setuptools]
py-modules = ["launchwin"]

[tool.setuptools.package-dir]
launchwin = "backend/client"

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests", "backend"]
pythonpath = ["backend/client"]
```

`py-modules` with a per module `package-dir` key is the smallest mapping setuptools offers:
`build_py.get_package_dir` resolves a top level module name through `package_dir` before it
falls back to the project root, so the module is built from `backend/client/launchwin.py`
with no copy of the file anywhere else, and the editable finder resolves `launchwin` to the
same path. The alternatives were rejected for stated reasons:

* a top level `launchwin.py` at the repository root that re-exported from `backend.client`
  would be a second name for one file and a file outside the paths this task may create;
* a `launchwin` package directory would need the module to become a package, which the
  task names as a file;
* `[tool.setuptools.packages.find] where` cannot mix a package root with the existing
  `include = ["backend*"]` discovery, and the service packages must keep resolving as they do.

`pythonpath` is the pytest `pythonpath` ini option, not a conftest hook and not an
`import` in the test module. It is what lets the suite exercise the module by the name a
user writes, `import launchwin`, before the distribution has been installed, and it is
asserted by `test_the_test_suite_can_reach_the_client_without_it_being_installed` so that
removing it is a failing test rather than a collection error.

`pandas` is a hard dependency in `[project].dependencies` rather than an optional import.
The A8 task allowed either, and the choice is recorded in interpretation 70.

### Commands run and their output

The A8 tests on their first run, with the client written and nothing corrected. The
collection failed rather than the tests, on a construct this interpreter's tokenizer rejects:
an f-string followed by `+ (` holding a multi-line conditional expression. It reproduces in
isolation with no other code present, and both files now avoid the shape.

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_client.py -q

```

The same suite on the next run. Seven of the eleven failures were the test asserting the
wrong thing, one was a decision about an empty environment variable that the module now
documents and the test now pins, and three were the harness: two a recorder built on an
asynchronous ASGI transport and one an import scan by regular expression.
Interpretation 78 lists all eleven.

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_client.py -q
11 failed, 40 passed, 2 skipped, 1 warning in 0.84s
```

The same suite after those eleven were addressed:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_client.py -q
6 failed, 46 passed, 2 skipped, 1 warning in 0.81s
```

and after the last six, which were the frozen schema's column order read wrongly, the
recorded rows carrying 98.08 rather than the requested 98.0, the recorded stub rows being
compared field by field, a track count that includes both ends of the grid, and the recorder
itself:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_client.py -q
52 passed, 2 skipped, 1 warning in 0.68s
```

The API suite, the acceptance command for this issue:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api -q
335 passed, 5 skipped, 1 warning in 2.73s
```

The contract suite, unchanged by this session and still green:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract -q
70 passed in 0.08s
```

The whole repository with the configured testpaths, which is the done condition:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
405 passed, 5 skipped, 1 warning in 3.07s
```

The five skips, each the assertion that checks a live path the day its workflow lands or, for
the first two, a distribution that has not been installed in this environment:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -rs
SKIPPED [1] backend/api/tests/test_client.py:781: launchwin is not importable in the virtual environment: the interpreter at .../.venv/bin/python cannot import it from /var/folders/.../launchwin-outside-repo-ep7_9mql, exiting 1 with 'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'launchwin\'; run pip install -e . in that environment first
SKIPPED [1] backend/api/tests/test_client.py:793: launchwin is not importable in the virtual environment: ... as above
SKIPPED [1] backend/api/tests/test_ephemeris.py:566: backend.engine.ephemeris has not landed yet
SKIPPED [1] backend/api/tests/test_weather.py:348: backend.weather.probability has not landed yet
SKIPPED [1] backend/api/tests/test_windows.py:338: backend.engine.compute_windows has not landed yet
```

Why the two client tests skip is a property of this workspace, and it is stated rather than
worked around. Neither `pip` nor `setuptools` is present in the virtual environment and there
is no network, so `pip install -e .` cannot be run here at all:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pip --version
./.venv/bin/python: No module named pip
$ .venv/bin/python -c "import setuptools"
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools'
```

What was verified instead. The two probe statements were run by hand from a temporary
directory outside the repository, with `PYTHONPATH` set to the two paths an editable install
of this repository would provide, `backend/client` for the `launchwin` module and the
repository root for the `backend` packages. Both statements are the ones the two skipped
tests run. The import probe printed the module path, and the call probe built the
application in the temporary directory, pointed the run store at a directory there as well,
and printed the summary the test asserts:

```
import launchwin; print(launchwin.__file__)
./backend/client/launchwin.py
```

```
import launchwin
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from backend.api.app import create_app
from backend.api.config import Settings
settings = Settings.load().with_runs_dir("<temporary directory>/runs")
with TestClient(create_app(settings)) as service:
    frame = launchwin.windows(
        target="SSO", site="canso", dates=("2026-10-04", "2027-01-01"),
        client=service,
    )
summary = "rows=%d engine=%s" % (len(frame), frame.attrs["response"]["engine_version"])
print(summary)
rows=3 engine=stub
```

And the five static assertions that hold the parts of the installation contract a change to
this workflow's own files could break:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/api/tests/test_client.py -q -k "layout or discovered or pandas or nothing_from_the_repository or without_it_being_installed" -v
================= 5 passed, 49 deselected, 1 warning in 0.50s ==================
```

The pandas version the suite ran against, for the record:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -c "import pandas; print(pandas.__version__)"
3.0.6
```

### Interpretations

Numbering continues from the G0 list, the A1-A3 list and the A4-A7 list above.

67. **The first clause of interpretation 66 is superseded.** It read "Not delivered,
    deliberately. No Python client (A8), no `scripts/integration_test.py` (A10), no `DONE.md`
    (A11)". The A8 task is delivered by this section. The A10 and A11 clauses stand.
68. **The DataFrame carries the window rows and the response stays whole.** A spec IV.1
    response is more than a table: it also carries `reachable`, `plane_change_dv_ms`,
    `sso_consistency_warning`, the constants block and the provenance block. A client that
    returned only the rows would make the provenance of a number unreachable from the number
    itself, which requirement 1 exists to prevent, so `windows` returns one row per window
    and the untouched response in `frame.attrs["response"]`. An empty result is the same
    shape with no rows, so a caller can read `reachable` and the penalty without a special
    case, and the columns are declared even when there are no rows so that a downstream
    selection does not raise on a column that is missing only because the answer was empty.
69. **The two nested objects of a row are flattened with distinguishing prefixes.**
    `p_success_components` becomes `p_weather`, `p_range` and `p_conjunction`; `screens`
    becomes `screen_hazard`, `screen_conjunction` and `screen_notam`. The prefix on the
    screen columns is forced: both objects of a spec IV.1 row hold a key called
    `conjunction`, so one column name cannot hold both without losing a field. The mapping
    is published as `COMPONENT_COLUMNS` and `SCREEN_COLUMNS` and the whole order as
    `WINDOW_COLUMNS`, and `test_the_columns_are_the_frozen_window_fields_with_two_objects_flattened`
    derives the expected order from the frozen `windows_response.json` rather than restating
    it, so a change to the contract at gate G0 fails this suite rather than passing quietly.
70. **`pandas` is a hard dependency, and the A8 task's either-or is resolved that way.** The
    task allowed "import launchwin succeeds without pandas installed, or pandas is a declared
    hard dependency". The declared hard dependency was chosen because two of the six public
    functions return a `DataFrame` by specification, so the import cannot be made lazy
    without turning the documented return type into a conditional one: a caller who omitted
    the dependency would get an `ImportError` at the moment they asked for an answer rather
    than at the moment they installed anything. `test_pandas_is_a_declared_hard_dependency`
    asserts it in `pyproject.toml` and asserts that it is not also an optional extra, which
    would read as an unresolved choice.
71. **Only two of the six functions return a frame.** `windows` and `ephemeris` return
    `pandas.DataFrame` objects because both are series. `weather`, `skill`, `site` and
    `citation` return the response document as a JSON object, because each is one answer
    with its evidence beside it: the components, the horizon label, the forecast issue time
    and the source of a probability are part of the answer, and a one row frame would invite
    a caller to drop them. Spec IV.9 names the methods and not their return types beyond the
    window call, so this is a choice and it is recorded here rather than left to be
    discovered.
72. **`dates` is required, and its order is not checked.** Spec IV.1 gives defaults for
    `site`, `criteria_version`, `raan_tolerance_deg` and `include_weather`, and gives no
    default date range, so a default would have been invented. Whether a range whose end
    precedes its start is an empty answer or a 422 is the service's decision to make from the
    frozen schema: the client checks the shape of its own argument, a pair or a mapping with
    `start` and `end`, and leaves the meaning to the contract.
73. **`LaunchwinError` carries a status for the four conditions of spec IV.7 rule 2, and no
    status for a request that never completed.** A 422, 404, 429 or 503 response raises with
    `status_code`, `detail`, `payload` and `retry_after_s` populated, the last because spec
    IV.7 and spec IV.8 require a `Retry-After` on 429 and on 503 and a caller should not have
    to parse it out of a message. A transport failure raises with `status_code` of `None`,
    because there is no status to report and inventing one would make an unreachable service
    look like a service that answered. Nothing else raises: an unreachable target, an empty
    window list and a fired constraint are answers and produce an empty frame with the
    response intact.
74. **The base URL is the argument, then `LAUNCHWIN_URL`, then
    `http://localhost:8000/v1`.** Trailing slashes are removed so that a value from a
    configuration file and one from a shell produce the same request URL. An empty
    environment variable reads as unset, because that is how a shell spells unset, while an
    empty argument raises: a caller who passed one made a mistake worth seeing. The request
    URL is built as an absolute string rather than handed to `httpx.Client` as a `base_url`
    to be joined, because the `client` a test passes has its own base URL, here
    `http://testserver`, and a relative path would have been resolved against that instead of
    against the configured service.
75. **Not delivered, and not verified, stated plainly.** The client exists and its whole
    surface is tested; two things about it could not be exercised in this workspace. The
    first is the editable install itself: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .` cannot run
    here, because the environment has neither `pip` nor `setuptools` and has no network, so
    `test_launchwin_imports_from_a_directory_outside_the_repository` and
    `test_launchwin_imports_and_calls_from_a_directory_outside_the_repository` skip. They
    skip with the interpreter's own error in the reason, and they will run as written the
    moment the distribution is installed; nothing about them was weakened to make the suite
    green. What was verified is the part a change to this workflow's files could break: the
    mapping in `pyproject.toml`, the hard `pandas` dependency, the absence of any import from
    the repository in the client module, and the probe statements themselves, which were run
    from a temporary directory with the paths an editable install would provide and which
    printed `rows=3 engine=stub`. The second is the two skipped skips of the A8 acceptance
    list that depend on that install; they are the only parts of A8 this commit does not
    demonstrate.
79. **Two lines of `backend/api/README.md` are now stale and were left alone.** The
    "Known gaps" section ends with "No Python client (A8), no integration harness (A10) and
    no `DONE.md` (A11)", and the opening paragraph reads "Tasks A1 to A7 of
    `docs/issues/issue-04-API.md` are complete. A8 to A11 are not." Both are true of the
    commit before this one and false of this one. The A8 task did not include the README in
    the paths it may edit, so neither line was changed here; A11 owns that file and both
    lines are its to correct. The client is documented where it lives instead, in the module
    docstring of `backend/client/launchwin.py`, in the packaging decision above, and in this
    section.
76. **`import launchwin` and `import backend.client.launchwin` are one file loaded twice.**
    `backend/client/__init__.py` exists so that `backend.client` is a package, and the
    distribution maps the same file as the top level module `launchwin`, so an interpreter
    that can reach both gives two module objects with two copies of every constant. Nothing
    in the client depends on the difference, and the suite therefore compares `__all__` and
    `__file__` rather than object identity. A caller must not either: two imports of the same
    module through two names are two modules, and an `is` comparison between objects from
    them fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the client.
77. **A client owned transport is opened and closed per call.** Without a `client`, the
    module builds an `httpx.Client` with the documented 30 s timeout, sends the request and
    closes it. A module level client would be faster for a caller making many calls, and it
    would also leave a connection pool alive in a notebook or a short lived script, so the
    cost was taken per call and the trade is stated here rather than left implicit.
    `test_the_module_opens_a_transport_of_its_own_and_closes_it` asserts the branch, the
    arguments and the closed state.
78. **Seven of the eleven failures of the first A8 run were the test asserting the wrong
    thing, and that is recorded rather than tidied away.** They were: an identity comparison
    between the two module objects of interpretation 76; a helper that appended a nested
    object field name as well as its flattened columns; two tests that read a
    `request_body` the frozen `windows_response` does not carry; an expectation that a null
    `constraint_fired` stays `None` in a frame rather than becoming `NaN`; an expectation
    that the message of an error carries the query string, which the message does not; and a
    track request of one day asserted to be beyond the three day propagation horizon, which
    it is not. The eighth was a decision rather than a mistake: an environment variable set
    to nothing was expected to raise where the module reads it as unset, so the behaviour was
    documented and split into two tests, one for each reading. The last three were the
    harness, twice a recorder built on an asynchronous ASGI transport that has no `close` and
    no `handle_request`, and once an import scan by regular expression that found the
    module's own name in its own docstring examples, replaced by a walk of the parse tree.
    No test was weakened: each expectation was either corrected to the contract or, where the
    contract was silent, replaced by an assertion of the documented decision.

## Integration fixes after ENGINE and WEATHER landed (4 October 2026)

Made on the branch `feature-weather-validation` by the WEATHER workflow at the repository owner's request, after
pull requests #12 and #17 put the real `backend.engine` and `backend.weather` on `main`. Before: 61 failing tests
in the repository, 40 of them in `backend/api/tests/`. After: `pytest backend/api -q` 349 passed, 3 skipped; whole
repository 949 passed, 4 skipped.

### Code

| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/api/weather.py`, `routes/windows.py`, `ephemeris.py` | the seams resolve the layer with `importlib.import_module` | `from backend import weather` returns the attribute of the `backend` package once the real module is imported, so a stand-in placed in `sys.modules` was never called |
| `backend/api/routes/windows.py` | the site is resolved before the engine is asked | the engine raises `ValueError` for an unknown site; spec IV.7 rule 2 says 404 |
| `backend/api/weather.py`, `routes/windows.py` | a weather error carrying `constraint_fired == "criteria_version_missing"` is not treated as an outage; rows without an engine constraint get that value | spec IV.1 enumerates it and spec IV.7 rule 3 puts constraint outcomes in the body. Before, the refusal was swallowed and every row was served with the neutral weather factor 1.0 |
| `backend/api/weather.py` | the live hindcast is asked for its full lead range and the series is cut afterwards | `lead_max` changed the reliability bins on the live path and only the series on the recorded path; the README documents the second |

The service default `criteria_version` stays `v1`. The weather layer now accepts `v1` as the short form of
`criteria_v1`, the name of its table.

### Tests

- `conftest.py`: the autouse fixture `layers` hides `backend.engine` and `backend.weather` from the import system
  for every test, which is the state the suite was written for, and sets `LAUNCHWIN_WEATHER_OFFLINE=1`. A test
  marked `live_layers` gets the real modules. No assertion of an existing test was removed.
- `test_live_layers.py`, new: the routes against the real engine and the real weather layer. Nine tests, one for
  each defect above plus the pass-through of a corridor-blocked target.
- `test_cache_and_limits.py`, `test_client.py`: the recorded skill period and leads are read from
  `backend/fixtures/skill.json`, which WEATHER generates, in place of the stand-in's literals.
- `test_client.py`: the out-of-repository call keeps its assertion `rows=3 engine=stub` on the offline path and
  gains a second test against the live engine.
- `test_citation.py`: `test_no_vehicle_row_is_invented_while_engine_has_not_landed` is skipped now that the
  vehicle file exists, and `test_the_vehicle_rows_are_the_rows_of_the_engine_file_and_nothing_else` asserts the
  rows the file provides.
- `test_fixtures.py`: every fixture's constants block must carry the values of `data/constants.json`.

### Open, for the API owner

1. The window route asks the weather layer once per response, for `date_range.start`, and applies the answer to
   every row. With the real layer a request starting 2026-10-05 returns the weather factor 0.0 and `FORECAST` on
   every row up to 2026-10-15. A date-resolved `p_success` needs one call per row date, and a decision on which
   date a liftoff near 02:40 UTC (23:40 local on the previous day) belongs to.
2. The table "Area, Status, Source served today" in `backend/api/README.md` still calls the window, weather and
   skill endpoints stubs. They answer from the real modules now; a note was added above the table.
3. The frozen contract examples under `tests/contract/examples/` carry `J2: 0.000108262668`, a tenth of the
   spec II.10 value. The fixtures were corrected; the examples were not touched.
